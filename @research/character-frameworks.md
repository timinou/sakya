# Character Frameworks and Personality Systems

This document surveys the major frameworks used by fiction writers for
developing complex, consistent, and compelling characters. Each framework
informs the design of Sakya's Character entity schema, spider chart
dimensions, and template system.


## The Enneagram System

### Overview

The Enneagram is a personality typology that identifies nine fundamental
types, each defined by a core motivation, a core fear, and a characteristic
pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Originally developed in
spiritual/psychological contexts (with roots in the work of Oscar Ichazo
and Claudio Naranjo), it has become one of the most popular character
development tools among fiction writers.

The Enneagram's value for fiction comes from several properties:
- Each type has a distinct internal logic that generates consistent behavior
- Types behave differently under stress and security, creating dynamic arcs
- Types exist on a spectrum from healthy to unhealthy, enabling character
  growth or decline
- The system captures motivation (why a character acts) rather than just
  behavior (how they act)

### The Nine Types

**Type 1: The Reformer**
- Core desire: To be good, to have integrity, to be balanced
- Core fear: Being corrupt, evil, defective
- Key motivation: Want to be right, strive higher, improve everything,
  be consistent with their ideals, justify themselves, be beyond criticism
- At their best: Wise, discerning, realistic, noble, morally heroic
- At their worst: Rigid, judgmental, self-righteous, obsessive, punitive
- Voice characteristics: Precise language, qualifying statements, "should"
  and "ought," controlled emotion that occasionally cracks

Example in fiction: Hermione Granger (Harry Potter), Atticus Finch
(To Kill a Mockingbird), Brienne of Tarth (A Song of Ice and Fire)

**Type 2: The Helper**
- Core desire: To feel loved and needed
- Core fear: Being unwanted, unworthy of being loved
- Key motivation: Want to be loved, express feelings for others, be needed,
  get others to respond to them
- At their best: Unconditionally loving, generous, humble, altruistic
- At their worst: Manipulative, possessive, martyring, entitled
- Voice characteristics: Questions about others' needs, offers of help,
  emotional language, difficulty saying no

Example in fiction: Samwise Gamgee (Lord of the Rings), Molly Weasley
(Harry Potter), Beth March (Little Women)

**Type 3: The Achiever**
- Core desire: To feel valuable and worthwhile
- Core fear: Being worthless, without inherent value
- Key motivation: Want to be affirmed, distinguish themselves, have attention,
  be admired, impress others
- At their best: Authentic, self-accepting, inspiring role models
- At their worst: Deceptive, narcissistic, hostile, exploitative
- Voice characteristics: Achievement-oriented language, image-conscious,
  adapts communication style to audience, efficiency-focused

Example in fiction: Jay Gatsby (The Great Gatsby), Tony Stark (Iron Man),
Tom Ripley (The Talented Mr. Ripley)

**Type 4: The Individualist**
- Core desire: To find themselves and their significance, to create an identity
- Core fear: Having no identity or personal significance
- Key motivation: Want to express themselves, be unique, process emotions
  through creativity, protect their self-image
- At their best: Inspired, creative, self-renewing, deeply honest
- At their worst: Self-absorbed, depressive, self-pitying, alienated
- Voice characteristics: Emotional depth, metaphor-heavy, aesthetic
  sensitivity, melancholic undertones, intensity

Example in fiction: Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights), Holden Caulfield
(The Catcher in the Rye), Elsa (Frozen)

**Type 5: The Investigator**
- Core desire: To be capable and competent
- Core fear: Being useless, helpless, or overwhelmed
- Key motivation: Want to possess knowledge, understand the environment,
  have everything figured out as a way of defending the self
- At their best: Visionary, pioneering, insightful, perceptive
- At their worst: Isolated, nihilistic, eccentric, detached
- Voice characteristics: Precise, observational, economical with words,
  compartmentalized emotion, technical vocabulary

Example in fiction: Sherlock Holmes, Wednesday Addams, Dr. Manhattan
(Watchmen)

**Type 6: The Loyalist**
- Core desire: To have security and support
- Core fear: Being without support or guidance, unable to survive on their own
- Key motivation: Want to have security, feel supported by others, have
  certainty, test the attitudes of others toward them
- At their best: Courageous, loyal, self-reliant, trustworthy
- At their worst: Paranoid, anxious, rigid, suspicious, reactive
- Voice characteristics: Questioning, contingency-planning, devil's
  advocate, "what if" language, oscillation between trust and doubt
- Note: Type 6 has two expressions --- phobic (moves toward fear) and
  counterphobic (moves against fear). The counterphobic 6 may appear
  bold and confrontational, masking underlying anxiety.

Example in fiction: Hamlet (Hamlet), Ron Weasley (Harry Potter),
Bilbo Baggins (The Hobbit)

**Type 7: The Enthusiast**
- Core desire: To be satisfied and content, to have needs fulfilled
- Core fear: Being deprived, trapped in pain
- Key motivation: Want to maintain freedom, avoid boredom, keep options
  open, maintain high stimulation, discharge tension
- At their best: Joyful, grateful, accomplished, generous
- At their worst: Impulsive, narcissistic, insatiable, escapist
- Voice characteristics: Rapid-fire, associative, optimistic, idea-
  generating, future-focused, deflects negative topics with humor

Example in fiction: Peter Pan, Fred and George Weasley (Harry Potter),
The Doctor (Doctor Who)

**Type 8: The Challenger**
- Core desire: To protect themselves, to determine their own course in life
- Core fear: Being harmed or controlled by others
- Key motivation: Want to be self-reliant, prove their strength, resist
  weakness, be important, dominate the environment, stay in control
- At their best: Magnanimous, heroic, protective, empowering
- At their worst: Tyrannical, ruthless, domineering, combative
- Voice characteristics: Direct, commanding, decisive, confrontational,
  blunt, action-oriented, protective of vulnerability

Example in fiction: Katniss Everdeen (The Hunger Games), Achilles (Iliad),
Kaz Brekker (Six of Crows)

**Type 9: The Peacemaker**
- Core desire: Inner stability, peace of mind, wholeness
- Core fear: Loss, fragmentation, separation, annihilation
- Key motivation: Want to create harmony, avoid conflict, preserve things
  as they are, resist whatever would upset or disturb them
- At their best: Indomitable, all-embracing, self-possessed, serene
- At their worst: Disengaged, stubborn, passive-aggressive, apathetic
- Voice characteristics: Meandering, agreeable, understated, uses hedging
  language ("maybe," "I guess"), tells stories rather than stating opinions
  directly, avoids confrontational words

Example in fiction: Winnie-the-Pooh, Aang (Avatar: The Last Airbender),
Frodo Baggins (Lord of the Rings)

### Dynamic Movement: Stress and Security

One of the Enneagram's most valuable features for fiction is that each type
shifts under different conditions:

**Under Stress (Disintegration):**
Each type takes on the negative qualities of another type when stressed.
- 1 -> 4 (becomes moody, irrational, self-pitying)
- 2 -> 8 (becomes aggressive, domineering, entitled)
- 3 -> 9 (becomes disengaged, apathetic, numb)
- 4 -> 2 (becomes needy, clingy, people-pleasing)
- 5 -> 7 (becomes scattered, impulsive, escapist)
- 6 -> 3 (becomes image-conscious, competitive, deceptive)
- 7 -> 1 (becomes rigid, critical, perfectionist)
- 8 -> 5 (becomes withdrawn, secretive, detached)
- 9 -> 6 (becomes anxious, paranoid, reactive)

**Under Security (Integration):**
Each type takes on the positive qualities of another type when healthy.
- 1 -> 7 (becomes spontaneous, joyful, playful)
- 2 -> 4 (becomes self-aware, emotionally honest, creative)
- 3 -> 6 (becomes loyal, committed, cooperative)
- 4 -> 1 (becomes disciplined, principled, purposeful)
- 5 -> 8 (becomes confident, decisive, action-oriented)
- 6 -> 9 (becomes relaxed, trusting, accepting)
- 7 -> 5 (becomes focused, profound, content with less)
- 8 -> 2 (becomes caring, generous, open-hearted)
- 9 -> 3 (becomes energized, self-developing, accomplished)

This dynamic system means a writer can map a character's entire arc through
Enneagram movements. A Type 3 character who starts unhealthy (deceptive,
image-obsessed) might hit rock bottom by disintegrating to 9 (complete
disengagement) before growing toward 6 integration (authentic loyalty).

### Wings

Each type is influenced by one or both of its neighboring types on the
Enneagram circle. A Type 4 might have a 3-wing (4w3, "The Aristocrat" ---
more ambitious, image-conscious) or a 5-wing (4w5, "The Bohemian" ---
more withdrawn, intellectual). Wings add nuance and explain why two
characters of the same type can feel quite different.

### Instinctual Variants

The three instinctual variants further differentiate characters within the
same type:
- **Self-Preservation (SP)**: Focus on physical safety, comfort, resources,
  health, practical concerns
- **Social (SO)**: Focus on group belonging, status within communities,
  social roles and hierarchies
- **Sexual/One-to-One (SX)**: Focus on intense personal connections,
  chemistry, attraction, rivalry

A self-preservation Type 7 (focused on collecting pleasurable experiences
and ensuring personal comfort) looks very different from a social Type 7
(the life of the party, sacrificing personal depth for group enthusiasm).

### Using the Enneagram for Character Voice

Each Enneagram type has a characteristic way of speaking and thinking that
writers can use to create distinct character voices:

The word choices, sentence structures, and thought patterns associated with
each type help writers avoid the common problem where all characters "sound
like the author." By filtering dialogue through the lens of a character's
Enneagram type, writers create voices that are internally consistent and
distinct from one another.

### Relevance to Sakya

The Enneagram system suggests several features for Sakya's Character entity:
- An Enneagram type field with optional wing and instinctual variant
- Stress and integration arrows displayed visually
- A "current state" slider or marker (healthy / average / unhealthy) that
  can be tracked across the narrative timeline
- Voice notes per character informed by their type
- A "character dynamics" view showing how different types interact
  (e.g., Type 8 and Type 2 have a specific dynamic worth tracking)


## Character Arc Frameworks

### The Universal Arc Shape

Virtually all character arc frameworks follow a common shape:

1. Character begins in a state of incompleteness, delusion, or flaw
2. External events force the character to confront this state
3. The character resists change
4. Through escalating pressure, the character is forced to choose
5. The character either embraces change (positive arc) or rejects it
   (negative arc)
6. The character emerges transformed (or destroyed)

### K.M. Weiland's Three Arc Types

K.M. Weiland, in "Creating Character Arcs," codified three fundamental
arc types that have become standard reference:

**Positive Change Arc (Growth)**

The character starts believing a Lie, and through the story's events,
comes to embrace the Truth.

Structure:
1. **First Act**: Character lives in the Lie. The Lie feels comfortable
   or at least familiar. The character's world is arranged to support the
   Lie (or they've arranged it that way).
2. **First Plot Point**: Something forces the character into a new world
   where the Lie doesn't work as well.
3. **First Pinch Point**: The character gets a glimpse of the Truth but
   isn't ready to accept it.
4. **Midpoint**: A moment of truth where the character shifts from
   reaction to action. They begin to question the Lie.
5. **Second Pinch Point**: The antagonistic force shows its full power,
   often exploiting the character's remaining attachment to the Lie.
6. **Third Plot Point**: The character's lowest moment. The Lie has
   devastating consequences.
7. **Climax**: The character faces a final choice between the Lie and
   the Truth. They choose the Truth.
8. **Resolution**: The character lives in the Truth. Their world has
   changed accordingly.

Example: Ebenezer Scrooge. Lie: "Money is the only security; human
connection is a vulnerability." Truth: "Love and connection give life
meaning." Each ghost visit is a plot point forcing confrontation with
the Lie.

**Negative Change Arc (Decline or Fall)**

The character starts with some awareness of the Truth but, through the
story's events, embraces the Lie. Three variations exist:

- **Disillusionment Arc**: The character believes a Lie, discovers a
  painful Truth, and is damaged by it. The world is darker than they
  believed. (Example: Michael Corleone in The Godfather)
- **Fall Arc**: The character is offered the Truth but rejects it,
  doubling down on the Lie until it destroys them. (Example: Walter
  White in Breaking Bad, Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars prequels)
- **Corruption Arc**: The character starts in the Truth, is seduced by
  the Lie, and is consumed by it. (Example: Macbeth)

**Flat Arc (Steadfast Character)**

The character already knows the Truth and does not change. Instead, they
change the world around them. The character is tested --- severely --- but
their conviction holds.

Structure:
1. The character enters a world that believes a Lie
2. The character's Truth is challenged by the world
3. Through the character's steadfast example, other characters change
4. The world is transformed by the character's influence

Example: Captain America (especially in "The Winter Soldier" and
"Civil War"). Steve Rogers knows what's right and doesn't waver. The
world around him changes in response to his integrity.

Flat arcs are common in:
- Series fiction (the protagonist can't change too much between books)
- Mentor characters
- Detective/mystery protagonists
- Characters representing a moral ideal

### The Six-Stage Character Arc

A more granular breakdown often used in craft books:

**Stage 1: First Impression**
How the character presents to the world. Their mask, their surface-level
personality. This is who they appear to be.

**Stage 2: Initial Flaw or Lie**
Beneath the surface, the character has a fundamental flaw, misbelief, or
wound that drives their behavior. Often, the First Impression is a
defense mechanism for this flaw.

**Stage 3: Inciting Incident**
An event that disrupts the character's equilibrium and puts pressure on
the flaw. The character's usual coping mechanisms are insufficient.

**Stage 4: Aha Moment / Moment of Insight**
The character glimpses the truth about themselves. This may be resisted,
partially accepted, or fully embraced depending on where the moment
falls in the story. Many stories have multiple aha moments of increasing
clarity.

**Stage 5: Commitment to Change**
The character makes a conscious choice to change, often at great personal
cost. This is not passive --- the character must act against their own
ingrained patterns.

**Stage 6: Final Transformation**
The character demonstrates their change through action in the climax.
The transformation is proven, not just stated. The character's behavior
in the final act should be recognizably different from the first act in
a way that stems directly from their growth.

### Tracking Character Arcs Across Scenes

For practical application, writers often create a character arc tracker
--- a timeline showing the character's emotional and psychological state
at each major beat:

| Beat | External Event | Internal State | Relationship to Lie/Truth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opening | Normal life | Comfortable in Lie | Fully believes Lie |
| Inciting Incident | Job loss | Destabilized | Lie is tested |
| Midpoint | Discovers ally lied | Crisis of identity | Questions everything |
| Low Point | Loses relationship | Rock bottom | Lie fully exposed |
| Climax | Final confrontation | Chooses Truth | Rejects Lie in action |

### Relevance to Sakya

Character arc frameworks suggest:
- A "Character Arc" section in the Character entity with fields for:
  Lie, Truth, Want, Need, Wound, Arc Type
- A timeline view showing a character's progression across story beats
- Scene-level annotations for "where is this character in their arc?"
- Arc type selection (positive, negative-disillusionment, negative-fall,
  negative-corruption, flat) that affects available template fields


## Motivation Systems

### The Lie/Want/Need/Truth Model

The most widely used motivation model in craft fiction, synthesized from
multiple sources (Weiland, McKee, Snyder):

**The Lie**: A false belief the character holds about themselves or the
world. This is not stupidity; it's a deeply held conviction that made
sense at some point (usually rooted in a formative wound).

Examples:
- "I don't deserve love" (rooted in childhood abandonment)
- "The world only respects strength" (rooted in past victimization)
- "If I'm perfect, I'll be safe" (rooted in conditional parental love)

**The Want**: The character's conscious, stated goal. What they're
actively pursuing. Often, the Want is the Lie's solution.

Examples:
- "I want to prove I'm the best detective" (because the Lie says "my
  worth depends on achievement")
- "I want to find my missing sister" (conscious goal that will force
  confrontation with the Lie)

**The Need**: What the character actually requires for genuine fulfillment.
The Need is typically the opposite of the Lie. The character may be
completely unaware of their Need at the story's beginning.

Examples:
- "I need to accept that I'm worthy of love regardless of achievement"
- "I need to learn to trust others"

**The Truth**: The realization that replaces the Lie. In a positive arc,
the character discovers the Truth and it transforms them. In a negative
arc, the character rejects the Truth.

The relationship between these four elements generates the story's
emotional core:
- The Lie creates the initial flaw
- The Want drives the plot forward
- The Need is what the story is really about
- The Truth is the destination (or the road not taken)

### Michael Hauge's Identity Model

Michael Hauge proposes that every character has two selves:
- **Identity**: The emotional armor the character wears to protect
  themselves from their deepest fear (wound). This is who they present
  to the world.
- **Essence**: The character's true self, hidden beneath the Identity.
  This is who they would be if they weren't afraid.

The character arc is the journey from Identity to Essence. The story
progressively strips away the Identity until the character must live
from their Essence.

Five stages of this journey:
1. **Fully in Identity**: Character lives behind their armor
2. **Glimpse of Essence**: A moment of vulnerability reveals the true self
3. **Torn**: Character oscillates between Identity and Essence
4. **Identity Collapses**: The armor fails completely
5. **Living in Essence**: Character embraces their true self (or refuses
   to and is destroyed)

### Memory-Identity-Destiny Framework

A character's motivation can be understood through three temporal lenses:

**Memories (Past)**: Formative experiences that explain why the character
holds their current beliefs and behaviors. Not just backstory --- specific,
vivid memories that the character carries with them and that surface during
the narrative.

- The memory of a parent's abandonment explains distrust
- The memory of a childhood humiliation explains perfectionism
- The memory of a moment of violence explains hypervigilance

**Identity (Present)**: How the character sees themselves right now. Their
self-concept, their roles, their values. Identity is where the Lie lives ---
the character's current understanding of who they are and what matters.

**Destiny (Future)**: What the character believes they are moving toward.
This may be a conscious goal (Want) or an unconscious pull (Need). Destiny
is where the Truth lives --- what the character will become if they embrace
change.

The tension between Memory, Identity, and Destiny generates dramatic
conflict:
- A character whose memories contradict their identity (a pacifist who
  remembers their capacity for violence)
- A character whose identity contradicts their destiny (a loner who is
  destined to lead)
- A character whose memories align too perfectly with their identity
  (a comfort zone that must be shattered)

### Maslow's Hierarchy as Character Motivation

Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs provides a framework for understanding
what characters want at different levels:

1. **Physiological**: Survival, food, water, shelter. Characters at this
   level are in survival mode. Stories here are about desperation and
   resourcefulness. (The Road, The Martian)

2. **Safety**: Security, stability, freedom from fear. Characters seek to
   establish safety. Stories here involve threat and protection. (Room,
   The Handmaid's Tale)

3. **Belonging/Love**: Friendship, family, romantic love. Characters seek
   connection. Stories here are about isolation and community. (Little
   Women, The Perks of Being a Wallflower)

4. **Esteem**: Respect, achievement, recognition. Characters seek status
   or self-worth. Stories here involve ambition and insecurity. (The
   Great Gatsby, Whiplash)

5. **Self-Actualization**: Fulfillment, meaning, becoming one's best self.
   Characters seek purpose. Stories here are about authenticity and
   legacy. (Dead Poets Society, Soul)

A character's dominant need level determines what motivates them. More
complex characters operate at multiple levels simultaneously.

### Relevance to Sakya

Motivation systems suggest:
- Fields in the Character entity for: Lie, Want, Need, Truth, Wound,
  Key Memories, Identity (self-concept), Destiny (arc destination)
- The ability to track motivation across the narrative (the Lie weakens,
  the Truth strengthens)
- Template sections that prompt writers for each motivational element
- A "motivation map" visualization showing the relationship between
  a character's Lie, Want, Need, and Truth


## Character Sheet Components

### Essential Fields

Drawing from the frameworks above and from standard industry practice,
a comprehensive character sheet should include the following categories:

**Basic Information**
- Full name (and any aliases, nicknames, titles)
- Age (at story start, and at key story points if the narrative spans time)
- Physical description (height, build, distinguishing features, style of
  dress, mannerisms)
- Role in story (protagonist, antagonist, mentor, love interest, etc.)

**Background**
- Place of origin
- Family structure and key relationships
- Education and formative experiences
- Occupation and skills
- Socioeconomic status
- Cultural and religious background

**Psychological Profile**
- Personality type (Enneagram, MBTI, or other system)
- Core fear
- Core desire
- Greatest strength
- Fatal flaw
- The Lie they believe
- The Truth they need to learn
- Defense mechanisms
- Coping strategies

**Voice and Manner**
- Speech patterns (formal/informal, verbose/terse, accent, vocabulary level)
- Distinctive phrases or verbal tics
- Internal monologue style (how they think differs from how they speak)
- Body language defaults (how they hold themselves, habitual gestures)

**Relational Dynamics**
- Key relationships and their quality
- How they treat strangers vs. intimates
- Power dynamics they gravitate toward (dominant, submissive, collaborative)
- Attachment style (secure, anxious, avoidant, disorganized)

**Arc Information**
- State at story beginning (First Impression, relationship to Lie)
- Key turning points in their personal arc
- State at story end (Final Transformation or lack thereof)
- Arc type (positive, negative, flat)

**Story-Specific**
- Scenes they appear in
- Their function in each scene
- Subplots they're involved in
- Relationship to the theme

### The Spider Chart Question

Many writing tools use spider charts (radar charts) to visualize
character attributes. The question is: what should the axes be?

**Physical Attributes Model (Common but Limited)**
Axes like Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Charisma. This comes from
tabletop RPGs and works for action-oriented stories but fails to capture
psychological complexity.

**Psychological Dimensions Model (More Useful for Fiction)**
Better axes for literary fiction and character-driven stories:
- Emotional Intelligence (self-awareness and empathy)
- Resilience (ability to withstand adversity)
- Moral Flexibility (willingness to bend ethics for goals)
- Social Dominance (tendency to lead or follow)
- Openness to Change (adaptability vs. rigidity)
- Self-Reliance vs. Dependence
- Rationality vs. Emotionality
- Introversion vs. Extraversion

**Dual Spider Chart Approach**
Use two spider charts per character:
1. **Capabilities**: What the character can do (strength, intelligence,
   social skills, technical skills, creativity, perception)
2. **Psychology**: How the character thinks and feels (the psychological
   dimensions above)

This captures both the external (plot-relevant) and internal (arc-relevant)
dimensions of a character.

**Arc-Aware Spider Charts**
The most sophisticated approach: allow the spider chart values to change
at different story points. A character might start with low Resilience
and high Moral Flexibility, and end with the reverse. Animating or
comparing these charts across the story reveals the arc visually.

### Character Relationship Mapping

Beyond individual character sheets, writers need to track relationships:

**Relationship Types**
- Family (blood, adopted, chosen)
- Romantic (current, past, unrequited)
- Professional (colleagues, rivals, mentor/mentee)
- Adversarial (enemies, obstacles, foils)
- Social (friends, acquaintances, community members)

**Relationship Dynamics**
- Power balance (equal, unequal, shifting)
- Trust level (high, low, conditional)
- Communication style (open, guarded, hostile)
- Shared history (brief, deep, complicated)
- Current trajectory (strengthening, deteriorating, stable)

**The Relationship Web**
A visual map showing all characters and their connections.
Color-coded by relationship type, with line thickness indicating
relationship importance. This is one of the most requested features
in writing software.

### Relevance to Sakya

Character sheet components inform Sakya's Character entity design:
- A structured but flexible character sheet with sections for each
  category above
- Configurable spider chart with customizable axes (not locked to a
  single model)
- The ability to define spider chart values at different story points
  to show character progression
- A relationship map visualization (graph/network diagram)
- Relationship entities that link two characters with metadata (type,
  quality, evolution)
- Template system that offers different character sheet templates:
  - Minimal (name, role, one-paragraph description)
  - Standard (basic info, background, psychology, arc)
  - Comprehensive (all categories above)
  - Framework-specific (Enneagram-focused, Lie/Truth-focused, etc.)


## Additional Personality Frameworks

### Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

While less dynamically useful for fiction than the Enneagram, MBTI is
widely known and provides quick character differentiation along four axes:
- Introversion (I) vs. Extraversion (E): Energy source
- Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N): Information gathering
- Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F): Decision making
- Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P): Lifestyle preference

The 16 resulting types (INTJ, ENFP, etc.) provide shorthand for character
behavior patterns. Many writers use MBTI as a starting point and the
Enneagram for depth.

### The Big Five (OCEAN Model)

The most scientifically validated personality model:
- **Openness to Experience**: Imagination, curiosity, willingness to try
  new things. High: creative, adventurous. Low: practical, conventional.
- **Conscientiousness**: Organization, dependability, self-discipline.
  High: diligent, reliable. Low: spontaneous, flexible.
- **Extraversion**: Sociability, assertiveness, positive emotions.
  High: outgoing, energetic. Low: reserved, solitary.
- **Agreeableness**: Cooperation, trust, empathy. High: compassionate,
  cooperative. Low: competitive, challenging.
- **Neuroticism**: Emotional instability, anxiety, moodiness.
  High: sensitive, nervous. Low: secure, confident.

The Big Five is useful because each dimension is a spectrum rather than
a binary, and the five dimensions are empirically independent. A character
can be high in both Openness and Conscientiousness, or low in Extraversion
but high in Agreeableness.

For spider charts, the Big Five provides five ready-made axes that
capture meaningful personality variation.

### Alignment Systems

The D&D alignment grid (Lawful/Neutral/Chaotic crossed with Good/Neutral/
Evil) is simplistic but useful as a quick reference for moral positioning.
More nuanced writers use it as a conversation starter: "This character
starts Lawful Good and ends Chaotic Good --- what happened?"

### Relevance to Sakya

Multiple framework support means:
- The Character entity should support optional personality type tags from
  multiple systems (Enneagram type + wing, MBTI type, Big Five scores)
- Spider chart axes should be configurable to match any framework
- Templates should exist for each major framework
- No framework should be mandatory --- a minimalist character sheet with
  just a name and description should be perfectly valid


## Comprehensive Relevance to Sakya

### Character Entity Schema Implications

The research above suggests the following schema for Sakya's Character
entity:

**Core Fields (Always Present)**
- Name
- Role (protagonist, antagonist, supporting, minor)
- Description (free-text)
- Image/avatar (optional)
- Scenes list (auto-linked from scene metadata)

**Optional Structured Sections**
- Background (place of origin, family, education, occupation)
- Psychological Profile (personality type, core fear, core desire,
  strengths, flaws)
- Arc Information (lie, truth, want, need, wound, arc type, key turning
  points)
- Voice Notes (speech patterns, verbal tics, internal monologue style)
- Relationships (links to other characters with relationship metadata)
- Custom Fields (user-defined key-value pairs)

**Visualization Components**
- Spider chart with configurable axes and values at multiple story points
- Relationship web position
- Arc timeline position

### Template Strategy

Offer multiple templates, each emphasizing different frameworks:

1. **Quick Start**: Name, role, one-paragraph description, one-line arc
2. **Standard**: All core fields plus background, psychology, arc info
3. **Enneagram-Based**: Emphasizes type, wing, stress/integration, health
   level progression
4. **Arc-Focused**: Emphasizes Lie/Truth/Want/Need, six-stage arc tracking
5. **Relationship-Focused**: Emphasizes connections to other characters,
   power dynamics, attachment styles
6. **Writer's Custom**: Start blank, add sections as needed

### Spider Chart Design Principles

Based on the research:
- Default to psychological dimensions (not physical RPG stats) unless
  the user's genre calls for it
- Allow custom axes
- Support snapshot-at-time-point: the same character can have different
  values at different story beats
- Provide presets for common frameworks (Big Five, Enneagram-derived,
  genre-specific)
- Keep the maximum number of axes reasonable (6--8 for readability)

### Relationship System Design

- Relationships are first-class entities, not just tags
- Each relationship links two characters with bidirectional metadata
- Relationships have types (family, romantic, professional, adversarial)
- Relationships have a quality spectrum (close/distant, trusting/suspicious)
- Relationships can change over the course of the story (tracked at
  beat level)
- The relationship web provides a bird's-eye view of all character
  connections
