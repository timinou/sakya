# Worldbuilding Frameworks and Practices

This document surveys the major approaches to worldbuilding used by fiction
writers across genres. While worldbuilding is most associated with fantasy
and science fiction, every story involves some degree of world construction
--- even contemporary realism requires the writer to select which aspects
of the real world to foreground, background, and omit. This research
informs Sakya's Place, Item, and custom entity schemas.


## Approaches to Worldbuilding

### Top-Down Worldbuilding

Top-down worldbuilding starts with the largest, most fundamental elements
of the world and works downward toward specifics. The writer begins by
establishing the macro rules --- the physics, the geography, the deep
history --- and then derives the cultures, societies, and individual
stories that would logically arise from those foundations.

**Process:**

1. **Cosmology and Physics**: What are the fundamental rules of this world?
   Is there magic? Faster-than-light travel? Multiple dimensions? How does
   the world differ from our own at the most basic level?

2. **Geography and Climate**: What does the physical world look like?
   Continents, oceans, mountain ranges, deserts, forests. Climate patterns
   determine where civilizations develop and how they interact.

3. **Deep History**: What happened before the story? Creation myths,
   ancient wars, fallen empires, geological events. The past shapes the
   present.

4. **Civilizations and Cultures**: What societies exist? How did geography
   and history shape them? What are their values, religions, social
   structures, economies, technologies?

5. **Politics and Power**: Who rules? How? What are the conflicts between
   groups? What alliances and rivalries exist?

6. **Daily Life**: What does ordinary life look like for ordinary people?
   Food, clothing, housing, work, leisure, family structures, rites of
   passage.

7. **The Story's Corner**: Finally, zoom into the specific place and time
   where the story takes place.

**Strengths:**
- Produces internally consistent worlds
- Excellent for series and shared universes where consistency matters
  across multiple stories
- The world feels deep and lived-in
- Geographic and historical logic prevents convenient coincidences
- Supports detailed maps, timelines, and encyclopedic references

**Weaknesses:**
- Very time-consuming
- Risk of over-developing areas irrelevant to the story
- Can lead to information dumps as the writer tries to showcase their work
- May prioritize world over character and plot
- Can become a form of productive procrastination (the writer worldbuilds
  endlessly instead of writing the novel)

**Notable Practitioners:**
- J.R.R. Tolkien (the archetypal top-down worldbuilder; created languages,
  histories, and mythologies before writing the stories)
- Brandon Sanderson (systematic magic systems developed from first principles)
- Frank Herbert (Dune's ecology, politics, religion, and economics form a
  deeply interconnected top-down system)
- George R.R. Martin (deep political and genealogical history)

### Bottom-Up Worldbuilding

Bottom-up worldbuilding starts with a specific element --- a character, a
scene, a "what-if" question --- and expands outward. The world develops
organically as the story demands it. Details are invented when needed and
then integrated into a growing understanding of the world.

**Process:**

1. **The Seed**: Start with a specific, concrete element. A character in
   a situation. A compelling image. A "what-if" question.
   - "What if a thief could steal memories?"
   - "A woman wakes up on a space station with no memory of how she got there."
   - "What if photosynthesis worked on sound instead of light?"

2. **Immediate Implications**: What does this seed element require? If a
   thief can steal memories, there must be a mechanism. What is it?
   Magical? Technological? Biological? Each choice spawns further questions.

3. **Expanding Rings**: Each answer generates new questions. If memory
   theft is magical, who can do it? Is it common or rare? Legal or illegal?
   How has society adapted to its existence? Each ring of questions expands
   the world.

4. **Selective Development**: Only develop what the story needs. If the
   protagonist never leaves the city, the world beyond the city walls
   can remain vague. Develop depth where the story lives.

5. **Retroactive Consistency**: As the world grows, periodically check
   that new elements are consistent with established ones. Revise as
   needed.

**Strengths:**
- Efficient: world development serves the story directly
- Reduces risk of information dumps (the writer only knows what matters)
- Keeps focus on character and plot
- More natural and less mechanical
- Better for character-driven stories where the world is backdrop

**Weaknesses:**
- Risk of inconsistencies
- The world may feel thin or underdeveloped in areas beyond the protagonist's
  experience
- Harder to manage in long series where world details accumulate
- May require significant revision when a later plot point requires a world
  element that contradicts an earlier one

**Notable Practitioners:**
- Stephen King (builds worlds from character situations, especially in
  the Dark Tower series)
- Ursula K. Le Guin (often started with a single anthropological or
  philosophical question and built outward)
- N.K. Jemisin (the Broken Earth trilogy builds its world progressively
  through the narrator's expanding understanding)

### Hybrid Approach

Most experienced worldbuilders use a hybrid approach:
- Top-down for foundational elements (physics, magic system, geography)
- Bottom-up for cultural details, character-level world interactions, and
  story-specific locations
- Iterative development: initial top-down sketch, then bottom-up
  development during drafting, then top-down consistency checks during
  revision

This hybrid approach is the most practical and is what Sakya should
primarily support.


## Brandon Sanderson's Strategic Focus Principle

### The Core Idea

Brandon Sanderson, one of the most successful worldbuilders in modern
fantasy, advocates for what he calls strategic depth: rather than trying
to develop every aspect of the world in equal detail, identify 2--4 key
elements and develop those deeply. Leave everything else to subtext,
implication, and the reader's imagination.

### Sanderson's Worldbuilding Layers

Sanderson describes worldbuilding as operating in layers:

**Layer 1: The Physical World**
Geography, climate, flora, fauna. The tangible environment characters
move through.

**Layer 2: The Cultural World**
Societies, governments, religions, economies, customs, art, cuisine.
How people organize themselves.

**Layer 3: The Magical/Technological World**
The unique systems that differentiate this world from ours. Magic systems,
advanced technology, unusual biology.

The Strategic Focus Principle says: go deep in one or two layers and let
the others be serviceable but not obsessively detailed. Tolkien went deep
on language and deep history (Layers 1 and 2). Sanderson goes deep on
magic systems (Layer 3). Both leave other areas less developed without
the reader feeling the lack.

### Sanderson's Laws of Magic

While specific to fantasy, Sanderson's Laws of Magic illustrate the
kind of systematic thinking that characterizes good worldbuilding:

**First Law**: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is
directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic
system.
- Implication: If magic will resolve plot problems, the rules must be
  clear (hard magic). If magic is mysterious and wondrous, it shouldn't
  resolve plot problems (soft magic).

**Second Law**: Limitations are more interesting than powers. What a
magic system can't do, or what it costs, creates more drama than what
it can do.
- Implication: Every worldbuilding system should have constraints. An
  economy has scarcity. A technology has side effects. A magic has costs.

**Third Law**: Expand what you already have before adding something new.
Find new implications of existing rules rather than inventing new rules.
- Implication: A deep, focused world is more compelling than a broad,
  shallow one.

### The Iceberg Principle

Ernest Hemingway's Iceberg Theory applies to worldbuilding: the reader
should see only 10--20% of the world you've built. The other 80--90%
exists beneath the surface, lending depth and consistency to what's
visible. The writer must know more than they show, but they must resist
the urge to show everything they know.

This principle means that Sakya's worldbuilding tools should support
extensive notes and details that never appear in the manuscript directly.
The wiki-like world bible is a tool for the writer, not the reader.

### Relevance to Sakya

Strategic Focus suggests:
- World entities should support both deep detail and light sketches
- The tool should not force equal development of all aspects
- A "depth indicator" or "development status" field per entity helps
  writers track which aspects are fully developed vs. placeholder
- Templates should offer different levels of detail for different
  entity types
- The tool should make it easy to cross-reference without requiring
  completeness


## World Taxonomy

### Secondary Worlds (Fully Fictional)

A secondary world is entirely invented by the author. It has no connection
to the real world (or the connection is minimal and framing, like a portal
fantasy).

**Characteristics:**
- The author defines all rules: physics, geography, history, culture
- Maximum creative freedom but maximum development burden
- Reader has no pre-existing knowledge to rely on, so worldbuilding must
  be communicated efficiently
- Internal consistency is paramount because the reader can't fill gaps
  with real-world knowledge

**Examples:**
- Middle-earth (Tolkien)
- Roshar (Sanderson's Stormlight Archive)
- Earthsea (Le Guin)
- Discworld (Pratchett)
- The Realm of the Elderlings (Hobb)

**Worldbuilding Requirements:**
Extensive. These worlds need geography, history, culture, language,
religion, economy, and often a magic system. The writer is building
everything from scratch.

### Primary World Extensions (Alternate History, Urban Fantasy, etc.)

These worlds start with the real world and modify it. The modification
can be subtle (an alternate history where one event went differently) or
dramatic (the real world but magic exists alongside technology).

**Subcategories:**

**Alternate History**: The real world, but a historical event went
differently. What if the Roman Empire never fell? What if the Axis
powers won World War II? What if the Cuban Missile Crisis escalated?
- Worldbuilding focus: Tracing the consequences of the divergence point
  through politics, technology, culture, and daily life
- Examples: The Man in the High Castle (Dick), 11/22/63 (King),
  Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell (Clarke)

**Urban Fantasy / Contemporary Fantasy**: The real world, but magical
or supernatural elements exist, often hidden from general awareness.
- Worldbuilding focus: How the magical world interacts with the mundane
  world. What are the rules of concealment? How does magic affect those
  who know about it?
- Examples: The Dresden Files (Butcher), American Gods (Gaiman),
  The Magicians (Grossman)

**Science Fiction (Near-Future)**: The real world extrapolated forward.
Technology has advanced, society has changed, but the roots are
recognizable.
- Worldbuilding focus: Technological and social extrapolation. What
  technology exists? How has it changed daily life, politics, economics?
- Examples: Neuromancer (Gibson), The Expanse (Corey), Station Eleven
  (Mandel)

**Superhero Fiction**: The real world, but some individuals have
extraordinary abilities.
- Worldbuilding focus: How superpowers interact with existing social,
  legal, and political structures.

**Worldbuilding Requirements:**
Moderate. The real-world foundation provides a lot for free. The writer
focuses on the specific modifications and their cascading effects.

### Realistic Contemporary (Real World + Fictional Elements)

The world is our world, as-is. But the writer invents specific elements
within it: fictional towns, fictional corporations, fictional families,
fictional events.

**Characteristics:**
- The macro world is real and doesn't need to be established
- Fictional elements must fit seamlessly into the real world
- Research replaces invention for most world details
- The writer's task is selection and arrangement, not creation

**Examples:**
- Most literary fiction
- Most thrillers and mysteries
- Most romance
- Most historical fiction (real world at a different time)

**Worldbuilding Requirements:**
Light but precise. The writer needs to know the real-world setting
intimately (through research or personal experience) and ensure their
fictional elements don't clash with reality. A crime novel set in
Chicago requires accurate geography, culture, and institutional knowledge.

### Genre Blends and Unusual Cases

Some works resist easy categorization:
- **Magical Realism**: The real world, but reality occasionally bends in
  ways that are not explained or questioned. (Garcia Marquez, Murakami)
- **Portal Fantasy**: Characters travel from the real world to a secondary
  world. Both worlds need development. (Narnia, The Magicians)
- **Dying Earth / Far Future**: So far in the future that the world is
  effectively a secondary world with vestigial connections to ours.
  (Vance, Wolfe)
- **Post-Apocalyptic**: The real world after a catastrophic event. Elements
  of both realistic contemporary and secondary world. (The Road,
  Station Eleven)

### Relevance to Sakya

The taxonomy matters because different project types need different tools:
- Secondary worlds need extensive entity systems (places, cultures,
  languages, magic systems, histories)
- Primary world extensions need focused entity systems (the magical
  elements, the divergence points, the key technologies)
- Realistic contemporary needs lightweight reference systems (real-world
  research notes, location descriptions, character dossiers)

Sakya must support the full range without forcing heavyweight worldbuilding
on a writer who's setting their story in present-day Brooklyn.


## World Elements in Detail

### Geography and Physical Environment

**Macro Geography:**
- Continental layout, ocean currents, mountain ranges
- Climate zones determined by latitude, altitude, ocean proximity
- Natural resources and their distribution (determines trade, conflict,
  settlement patterns)
- Geological history (why the landscape looks the way it does)

**Micro Geography (Story-Relevant):**
- Specific locations where scenes take place
- The feel of a place: sounds, smells, textures, light quality
- How geography constrains movement and communication
- Seasonal variation and its effects on daily life

**The Map Question:**
Many fantasy writers create maps. A good map:
- Shows only what the reader/writer needs
- Reflects realistic geography (rivers flow downhill, deserts form in
  rain shadows, cities develop near water and trade routes)
- Can evolve as the story develops (new areas explored)
- Serves as a reference tool, not a showcase of geographic trivia

### History and Timeline

**Types of Historical Detail:**

**Deep History (millennia ago):**
- Creation myths and origin stories
- Ancient civilizations and their legacies
- Geological and ecological changes
- The origin of current power structures

**Recent History (generations ago):**
- Wars and their consequences
- Political upheavals and revolutions
- Technological or magical developments
- Migrations and demographic shifts

**Living Memory (within characters' lifetimes):**
- Events characters experienced firsthand
- Generational trauma and its effects
- Current conflicts with historical roots
- How different characters remember the same events differently

**The Timeline Tool:**
A worldbuilding timeline is distinct from a story timeline:
- The worldbuilding timeline covers all of history
- The story timeline covers only the narrative period
- Events on the worldbuilding timeline inform the story timeline
  but mostly remain off-page
- The tool should support both timelines, clearly distinguished

### Culture and Society

**Social Structure:**
- Class systems, caste systems, or egalitarian models
- Social mobility (or lack thereof)
- Institutions (government, religion, education, military)
- Gender roles and family structures
- How outsiders/foreigners/minorities are treated

**Economy:**
- What is the basis of wealth? (Agriculture, trade, manufacturing,
  extraction, knowledge)
- What is the currency? (Coins, barter, credit, reputation)
- What is scarce? What is abundant?
- Who controls the means of production?
- How does economic reality affect daily life?

**Religion and Philosophy:**
- What do people believe about the nature of the universe?
- Is there evidence for or against their beliefs?
- How does religion interact with political power?
- What are the moral frameworks? How do they differ between groups?
- What are the rituals, celebrations, and mourning practices?

**Technology and Knowledge:**
- What is the general technological level?
- Are there areas of unusually advanced or unusually primitive technology?
- How is knowledge preserved and transmitted?
- What is the relationship between technology and magic (if both exist)?

**Art, Language, and Expression:**
- What forms of art exist? Which are valued?
- Are there multiple languages? What are the dynamics between them?
- What are the storytelling traditions?
- What is taboo to express? What is celebrated?

### Magic Systems and Speculative Elements

**Hard Magic Systems:**
Clear rules, consistent limitations, and defined costs. The reader
understands how magic works, which allows it to solve problems in the
narrative without feeling like a deus ex machina.

Components of a hard magic system:
- Source: Where does the power come from?
- Mechanism: How is it activated and controlled?
- Limitations: What can't it do?
- Cost: What does it take from the user?
- Cultural impact: How has its existence shaped society?
- Progression: Can users get better? How?

Examples: Allomancy in Mistborn (Sanderson), Sympathy in The Kingkiller
Chronicle (Rothfuss), Bending in Avatar: The Last Airbender

**Soft Magic Systems:**
Mysterious, wondrous, loosely defined. The reader doesn't fully understand
the rules, which creates a sense of awe and danger. Soft magic should
create problems for characters more than it solves them.

Examples: Magic in Lord of the Rings, The Force in Star Wars (original
trilogy), magic in Earthsea (Le Guin)

**The Hard-Soft Spectrum:**
Most magic systems fall on a spectrum. A system might have hard elements
(clearly defined powers) and soft elements (mysterious origins). The
key is internal consistency and appropriate use.

**Speculative Technology (Science Fiction):**
Functions similarly to magic in terms of worldbuilding:
- What exists? (FTL travel, AI, genetic engineering, nanotechnology)
- What are the limitations?
- What are the costs and side effects?
- How has it changed society?
- Is it widely available or restricted?

### Items and Artifacts

Items of significance in a fictional world often carry worldbuilding weight:

**Types of Notable Items:**
- **Magical/Technological Artifacts**: Items with special properties
  (The One Ring, a lightsaber, a Horcrux)
- **Cultural Artifacts**: Items of cultural or religious significance
  (a sacred text, a crown, a treaty document)
- **Personal Artifacts**: Items meaningful to specific characters
  (a locket from a dead parent, a first edition book)
- **Economic Items**: Currencies, trade goods, rare materials
  (spice in Dune, vibranium in Marvel, latinum in Star Trek)

**Item Schema for Worldbuilding:**
Each notable item might include:
- Name and physical description
- Origin/history
- Properties (magical, technological, symbolic)
- Current location/owner
- Significance to the story
- Connections to other entities (characters, places, events)


## Best Practices

### Avoid Information Dumps

The cardinal sin of worldbuilding is the information dump --- stopping
the narrative to explain world details. Better approaches:

**Show Through Character Interaction:**
Don't tell the reader that the social class system is rigid. Show a
character being denied entry to a place, or deferring to someone of
higher status, or rebelling against expectations.

**Use Conflict to Reveal:**
Worldbuilding details emerge most naturally when they're the source of
or context for conflict. A character struggles with a magical limitation.
Two characters argue about a historical event. A travel scene reveals
geography through the difficulties of the journey.

**Drip-Feed Information:**
Reveal world details gradually, as they become relevant. Trust the reader
to accumulate understanding over time. The reader doesn't need to
understand the entire magic system in Chapter 1 --- they need to
understand the specific magical element relevant to the current scene.

**Use Specific Detail Instead of General Explanation:**
Instead of: "The economy was based on the mining of precious stones."
Try: "Mirael counted the rough sapphires in her palm --- enough for a
week's food, if the markets hadn't been flooded with stones from the
new mine."

**The "As You Know, Bob" Test:**
If a character is explaining something to another character who already
knows it, that's an information dump disguised as dialogue. Characters
should only explain things the listener genuinely doesn't know.

### Maintain Internal Consistency

Internal consistency is the single most important quality of a
well-built world. The reader will forgive almost any premise as long
as the world follows its own rules.

**Strategies for Consistency:**

**World Bible / Reference Document:**
Maintain a central reference document (or database) that records all
established world facts. Consult it regularly during writing and revision.
This is one of the primary functions Sakya should serve.

**Consequence Tracking:**
When establishing a world element, trace its implications:
- If magic can heal wounds, why do doctors exist?
- If teleportation is possible, what happens to the economy of travel?
- If dragons exist, how has their presence shaped architecture, military
  strategy, and agriculture?

Every worldbuilding choice has consequences. Tracking them prevents
contradictions.

**The Rule of Extrapolation:**
For every major world element, ask "what else would be true?" at least
three times:
1. If this society has no concept of personal property, what does housing
   look like? (Communal)
2. If housing is communal, what does privacy look like? (Redefined or
   nonexistent)
3. If privacy is nonexistent, what does intimacy look like? (Very
   different from our assumptions)

**Revision Pass for Consistency:**
Dedicate at least one revision pass specifically to worldbuilding
consistency. Read the manuscript looking only for contradictions,
impossibilities, and unstated implications.

### Subordinate Worldbuilding to Story

The world serves the story, not the other way around. This principle
has several practical implications:

**Develop What the Story Needs:**
If the story takes place entirely in one city, the detailed history of
a distant continent is worldbuilding for its own sake. Develop it if
you enjoy it, but don't let it slow down the story.

**Cut Beloved Details:**
Some of the most carefully developed world details will never make it
into the narrative. This is normal and healthy. The details still serve
a purpose: they informed the writer's understanding, which creates a
richer, more confident narrative voice.

**Character as Lens:**
The reader experiences the world through the characters. A farmer and a
nobleman walking through the same market will notice entirely different
things. Use POV to filter world details through character perception.

**Theme Alignment:**
The best worldbuilding reinforces the story's themes. If the theme is
about freedom vs. control, the world's political structures, magic
system, and social norms should all reflect this tension in different
ways.

### Integrate Through Character Interaction

The most effective worldbuilding is invisible --- it's embedded in how
characters interact with their environment:

**Daily Routines:**
How characters eat, sleep, work, and socialize reveals the world without
exposition. A character's morning routine in a space station teaches
the reader about artificial gravity, recycled water, shift schedules,
and social hierarchies without a single line of explanation.

**Language and Idiom:**
Characters in a seafaring culture use nautical metaphors. Characters in
a desert culture have twelve words for sand. Characters under an
authoritarian regime speak in euphemisms. Language carries worldbuilding.

**Assumptions and Surprises:**
What characters take for granted reveals what's normal in their world.
What surprises them reveals what's unusual. A character who doesn't
react to a dragon but gasps at a horse tells the reader volumes.

**Conflict and Negotiation:**
When characters disagree, they often disagree about world-level issues
--- religion, politics, morality, resources. These disagreements are
natural vehicles for worldbuilding that also advance character and plot.


## Relevance to Sakya: Comprehensive Design Implications

### Entity Schema Design

The research above informs the design of several entity types in Sakya:

**Place Entity**

A Place entity should support:

*Core Fields:*
- Name (and alternate names / names in different languages)
- Type (continent, country, region, city, building, room, natural feature,
  etc.)
- Description (free-text, sensory-rich)
- Parent location (enabling hierarchical nesting: Room -> Building ->
  City -> Region -> Country -> Continent)
- Geographic coordinates or relative position (for map integration)
- Image/map attachment

*Optional Structured Fields:*
- Climate and environment
- Population and demographics
- Government and power structures
- Economy and resources
- Culture and customs
- History (key events that shaped this place)
- Current status/condition
- Notable features
- Dangers or challenges

*Relational Fields:*
- Characters associated with this place (residents, visitors, rulers)
- Events that took place here
- Items found or stored here
- Connected places (trade routes, borders, portals)
- Scenes set here

**Item Entity**

An Item entity should support:

*Core Fields:*
- Name
- Type (artifact, weapon, tool, document, currency, material, creature,
  vehicle, etc.)
- Description
- Image attachment

*Optional Structured Fields:*
- Origin/history
- Properties (magical, technological, symbolic)
- Condition/state
- Value/rarity
- Current location
- Current owner/possessor

*Relational Fields:*
- Characters who have owned/used this item
- Places where this item has been or is currently
- Events involving this item
- Related items (parts of a set, replicas, counterparts)
- Scenes where this item appears

**Custom Entity Type**

For worlds that need entity types beyond Character, Place, and Item,
Sakya should support custom entities. Common custom types include:
- Magic System / Technology System
- Culture / Civilization / Faction
- Language
- Species / Race / Creature Type
- Religion / Philosophy
- Historical Era / Event
- Organization / Institution

Each custom entity type should have:
- A user-defined name
- A user-defined set of fields
- The same relational capabilities as built-in entities (can link to
  characters, places, items, scenes, and other custom entities)

### Supporting the Full Worldbuilding Spectrum

Sakya must gracefully serve projects ranging from zero worldbuilding to
extreme worldbuilding:

**Level 0: No Worldbuilding (Contemporary Realism)**
The writer may not create any Place, Item, or custom entities. The world
is our world. Scene locations are described in the manuscript text alone.
Sakya should not present empty worldbuilding sections that make the
project feel incomplete.

**Level 1: Light Worldbuilding (Contemporary with Fictional Elements)**
A few fictional locations (a made-up small town), maybe some significant
items (a family heirloom that drives the plot). Minimal entity creation.
Quick-add with just a name and short description.

**Level 2: Moderate Worldbuilding (Urban Fantasy, Near-Future SF,
Alternate History)**
The real world with modifications. Some custom entities for the speculative
elements (a magic system, a technology, an alternate historical event).
Moderate entity creation with selective depth.

**Level 3: Heavy Worldbuilding (Secondary World Fantasy, Space Opera)**
A fully invented world with extensive entities across all categories.
Deep detail for key elements (per Sanderson's Strategic Focus Principle),
lighter detail for others. The writer needs robust search, cross-
referencing, and consistency tools.

**Level 4: Encyclopedic Worldbuilding (Tolkien-Level)**
Massive world bibles, constructed languages, detailed timelines spanning
millennia. The entity system is a database unto itself. The writer needs
bulk management, advanced filtering, and export capabilities.

Sakya should default to Level 1--2 complexity (don't overwhelm) but scale
gracefully to Level 3--4 for writers who need it.

### Cross-Linking and Consistency

The single most important worldbuilding feature in a writing tool is
cross-linking between entities. When a writer mentions a place in a scene,
they should be able to link to the Place entity. When a character picks up
an item, the link to the Item entity provides instant access to that item's
history and properties.

**Types of Links:**
- Scene -> Place (where the scene is set)
- Scene -> Character (who appears in the scene)
- Scene -> Item (what items appear or are mentioned)
- Character -> Place (where the character lives, works, has been)
- Character -> Character (relationships)
- Character -> Item (what the character owns, carries, seeks)
- Place -> Place (borders, contains, connected to)
- Item -> Place (located at, originated from)
- Item -> Character (owned by, created by)
- Any Entity -> Custom Entity (culture, faction, magic system, etc.)

**Bidirectional Navigation:**
Every link should be navigable in both directions. If a scene links to a
character, the character's page should show all scenes they appear in.
If an item links to a place, the place's page should show all items
associated with it.

**Consistency Checking:**
Advanced feature: if a character is established as being in City A in
Scene 12 and appears in City B in Scene 13 with no travel scene between,
flag the potential inconsistency. This is especially valuable in complex
narratives with many characters and locations.

### Templates by Genre

Different genres emphasize different worldbuilding elements. Sakya should
offer genre-aware templates:

**Fantasy Template:**
- Place entities emphasize: geography, culture, history, magic
- Item entities emphasize: magical properties, lore, quests
- Custom entities suggested: Magic System, Species/Race, Religion, Language

**Science Fiction Template:**
- Place entities emphasize: technology level, environment (habitable?),
  political structure, resource availability
- Item entities emphasize: technology, function, rarity
- Custom entities suggested: Technology System, Species, Faction,
  Historical Era

**Mystery/Thriller Template:**
- Place entities emphasize: layout/floor plans, security, access points,
  atmosphere
- Item entities emphasize: evidence, weapons, documents, clues
- Custom entities suggested: Organization, Timeline of Events

**Historical Fiction Template:**
- Place entities emphasize: period-accurate description, social context,
  historical events
- Item entities emphasize: period-appropriate objects, historical artifacts
- Custom entities suggested: Historical Event, Cultural Practice, Social
  Class

**Contemporary/Literary Fiction Template:**
- Place entities emphasize: sensory description, emotional associations,
  character connections
- Item entities emphasize: symbolic significance, personal history
- Minimal custom entities (add as needed)

**Romance Template:**
- Place entities emphasize: atmosphere, romantic potential, social context
- Item entities emphasize: gifts, tokens, symbols of relationships
- Custom entities suggested: Social Circle, Family Tree

### Visualization Tools

Worldbuilding benefits significantly from visual tools:

**Map View:**
- An interactive map where Place entities can be positioned
- Hierarchical zoom (continent -> country -> city -> building)
- Connection lines showing routes, trade paths, character journeys
- Layer toggles (political borders, geographic features, story locations)

**Timeline View:**
- Historical events arranged chronologically
- Multiple tracks (political history, character histories, story events)
- Zoom from millennia to days
- Event-to-entity linking (this battle involved these characters at this
  place)

**Relationship Web:**
- Network graph showing all entity connections
- Filterable by entity type, relationship type, or story segment
- Cluster detection (which entities are heavily interconnected?)
- Useful for spotting orphaned entities (places mentioned once and
  forgotten)

**Entity Dashboard:**
- Overview of all world entities by type
- Development status indicators (fully developed, sketch, placeholder)
- Quick-add and quick-edit capabilities
- Search and filter across all entity types

### Information Architecture Principles

Based on the research, several principles should guide Sakya's
worldbuilding information architecture:

**1. Progressive Disclosure**
Show only what's needed at each level. A scene view shows scene-relevant
entities. A world overview shows all entities. A character view shows
that character's connections. Don't overwhelm with the full world
database at every turn.

**2. Graceful Scaling**
The system should feel lightweight for a project with 3 Place entities
and heavyweight-capable for a project with 300. The same tool, different
density.

**3. Optional Depth**
Every field beyond name and description should be optional. A Place can
be just "The Old Mill --- a crumbling watermill on the edge of town" or
it can be a full encyclopedia entry. Both are valid.

**4. Search and Discovery**
As the world grows, finding things becomes critical. Full-text search
across all entities, type-based filtering, and tag-based organization
are essential.

**5. Export and Reference**
Writers often need their world bible in a readable format outside the
tool. Export to Markdown, PDF, or other formats. Print-friendly layouts
for reference during writing sessions.

**6. Living Document**
The world bible is never finished. It changes as the story evolves.
The tool should support ongoing modification without friction --- no
"lock" states, no required fields that block saving an incomplete entry,
no artificial barriers to capturing a quick idea.
