## Description

The central conceit of the story: nostalgia literally bends time. [[Carver Street]] is longer at night because Elena is measuring distance from her past. [[The Amber Hour]] dilates an hour into three because the bar exists in emotional time, not clock time. The [[Coffee Cup]] stays warm because warmth is what Elena associates with the people she's missing.

This isn't science fiction—it's the magical realism of subjective experience. Everyone has felt a place feel larger or smaller depending on their emotional state. Everyone has experienced time moving differently when they're remembering. The story makes the subjective literal.

The theme manifests through:
- Spatial distortion: streets longer, rooms smaller, distances elastic
- Temporal distortion: hours that feel like minutes, minutes like hours
- Object temperature: warm when missed, cooling as Elena makes peace
- Sound distortion: the [[Mixtape]] playing different songs, voices in memory sounding different

The resolution isn't that time stops bending—it's that Elena stops needing it to. The world returns to normal dimensions when she's ready to live in the present.
