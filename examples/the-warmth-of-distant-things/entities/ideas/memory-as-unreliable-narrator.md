## Description

Elena is the narrator, but her memories are unreliable—and the story knows it. The [[Photographs]] shift because memory itself shifts. The group's conversations at [[The Amber Hour]] are recalled differently each time Elena revisits them. [[Sam Reeves]] is both more and less than who he actually was; [[Margot Chen]] is both villain (the one who left) and hero (the one brave enough to go).

This manifests structurally:
- The same scene recalled twice with different details
- Elena correcting herself mid-narration ("No, that's not right. He said—")
- Other characters remembering things differently when they appear ([[David Okafor]] gently correcting Elena's version of the night Margot left)
- The photographs' shifting expressions: are they magical, or is Elena seeing what she needs to see?

The theme resolves when Elena accepts that her memories are a story she's telling herself, not an archive she's accessing. The past isn't a place she can return to because it was never a fixed place to begin with. The warmth she feels isn't from the past—it's from her.
