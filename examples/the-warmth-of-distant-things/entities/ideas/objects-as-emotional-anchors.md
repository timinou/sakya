## Description

Physical objects carry emotional weight that manifests as subtle magic. This is the most tangible expression of the story's magical realism:

- The [[Coffee Cup]]: warm when Elena is thinking about someone she misses. The warmth is literal but the cause is emotional.
- The [[Photographs]]: expressions shift subtly. Fixed images that aren't quite fixed—because memory isn't fixed.
- The [[Mixtape]]: plays different songs depending on Elena's emotional state. Music as emotional mirror.

These objects function as transitional objects in the psychological sense—bridges between Elena's internal state and the external world. They're how the story makes feelings physical without being allegorical. The coffee cup isn't a metaphor for warmth; it's warm. The photographs aren't a metaphor for shifting memory; they shift.

The motif tracks Elena's arc:
- **Beginning**: Objects are active, magical, insistent. The cup is always warm. The photos are always shifting.
- **Middle**: Elena begins to notice the pattern. The magic is connected to her, not to the objects.
- **End**: Objects settle. The cup cools. The photos fix. Not because the magic is gone, but because Elena doesn't need external anchors for internal feelings anymore.

This connects to the broader question: do objects hold memories, or do we project memories onto objects? The story doesn't answer—it holds both possibilities simultaneously.
