## Personality & Voice

David is the most grounded of the group—literally builds bridges for a living. He has a deep, easy laugh and the kind of steady presence that makes other people calm down. He's direct without being harsh. When [[Margot Chen]] was dramatic and [[Sam Reeves]] was quiet, David was the one who said the obvious true thing that nobody else would say.

He's the only one from the group that [[Elena Vasquez]] still sees regularly, though "regularly" has stretched from weekly to monthly. He always suggests [[The Amber Hour]] when they meet, out of loyalty or habit—Elena can't tell which.

## Backstory

David met Elena and Margot through a mutual friend at a party. He became the group's quiet center—the one who drove everyone home, who remembered birthdays, who texted "you good?" after a bad day. He married his partner Isa two years ago. The wedding was the last time the whole group was in one room.

## Character Arc

David represents continuity. He's the friend who stayed, who adapted, who built a life that includes the past without being consumed by it. His marriage and growing family aren't a betrayal of the group—they're what growing up looks like. Elena finds him both comforting and slightly painful to be around. He's proof that moving forward is possible, which is exactly what she's not ready to hear.
