## Personality & Voice

Elena narrates in first person with a translator's precision—she notices the exact shade of light, the specific way someone holds a glass. She has an instinct for the gap between what people say and what they mean. Her internal monologue slides between languages; certain memories only exist in Spanish.

She's warm but guarded. Makes self-deprecating jokes as deflection. Laughs easily but cries privately. Has a habit of translating phrases in her head during conversations, looking for the word that fits better in the other language.

## Backstory

Grew up bilingual in a mixed household. Her twenties were spent in a tight-knit group of friends who felt like found family—late nights at [[The Amber Hour]], long walks through [[Carver Street]], the feeling that time was infinite. The group dissolved gradually after [[Margot Chen]] moved to Berlin and [[David Okafor]] got married. Elena's romantic relationship with [[Sam Reeves]] ended ambiguously—not with a fight but with a slow fade.

She now lives alone in a different neighborhood. Works from home. Has a cat named Borges. The distance from her twenties isn't geographic—it's temporal, and it's growing.

## Character Arc

Elena begins the story unable to let go of a decade that's already over. She keeps the [[Coffee Cup]] on her desk. She walks past the old apartment on [[Carver Street]] even though it's out of her way. Through the story, she doesn't "get over" her past—instead she learns to hold it without being held by it. The magical elements (warm coffee, shifting photographs) gradually fade as she stops needing them, replaced by a quieter, present-tense contentment.

Flat arc with internal shift: Elena doesn't fundamentally change who she is. She changes her relationship to time.
