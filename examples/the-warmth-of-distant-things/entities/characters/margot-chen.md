## Personality & Voice

Margot is the friend who was always leaving. Even when she was in the room, part of her was planning the next thing. Charismatic, funny, occasionally cutting. She speaks in declarative sentences—rarely asks questions, more often makes observations that function as questions. Has a photographer's eye; describes the world in terms of light and framing.

She's the one who organized things—the one who said "let's go to [[The Amber Hour]] tonight" and made it feel inevitable. Without her gravity, the group lost its orbit.

## Backstory

Margot grew up as an only child in Vancouver. Moved to the city for film school, where she met [[Elena Vasquez]] in a subtitling workshop. They became inseparable—Elena's quiet attention balanced Margot's restless energy. Margot left for Berlin three years ago to work on a documentary about memory palaces. She and Elena exchange long voice messages but haven't seen each other in person since.

## Character Arc

Margot exists mostly in Elena's memory. When she appears—in a phone call, in a photograph on Elena's desk—she's simultaneously the person Elena misses and someone who has already moved on. She represents the friend who outgrew the group, and the guilt of being the first to leave. Her voice messages from Berlin are warm but clearly from a different life.
