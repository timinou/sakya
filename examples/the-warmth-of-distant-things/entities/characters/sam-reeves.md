## Personality & Voice

Sam is gentle where [[Elena Vasquez]] is precise. He speaks slowly and means what he says—no subtext, no irony. He's the kind of person who remembers your favorite song from a conversation you had three years ago. He plays piano badly and enthusiastically. He's allergic to cats, which is a small cruel joke the universe played on both of them.

He's not ambitious in any conventional sense. He wanted to teach kids music and be with people he loved and play piano in the evenings. This simplicity was both what Elena loved and what eventually created distance between them—she couldn't tell if she was bored or terrified of how content he was.

## Backstory

Sam and Elena dated for two years in their mid-twenties. They never officially broke up—Sam moved to a different part of the city for a teaching job, visits became weekly then monthly then holidays then nothing. The [[Mixtape]] was the last thing he gave her. They still follow each other on social media. Neither has unfollowed. Neither has reached out.

## Character Arc

Sam appears in Elena's memories as a kind of warmth she can't quite name. He represents the path not taken—not because it was wrong, but because she was too restless to stay still. His presence in the story is elegiac rather than dramatic. When Elena finally listens to the [[Mixtape]] and hears different songs than she remembers, it's because she's finally hearing what he was actually trying to say.
