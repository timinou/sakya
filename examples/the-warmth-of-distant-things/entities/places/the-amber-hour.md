## Atmosphere & Mood

The Amber Hour is a narrow bar on a side street, the kind of place you can only find if you already know where it is. Warm yellow lighting from Edison bulbs. A long wooden bar with a patina of rings from a thousand glasses. The jukebox still plays CDs—[[Margot Chen]] used to feed it quarters. It smells like old wood and citrus peel and something sweet that might be decades of spilled vermouth.

The sound is always a low murmur. Even on busy nights, it never gets loud. The bartender, who has been there since before anyone can remember, makes drinks without being asked if you've been enough times. [[Elena Vasquez]] drinks mezcal here. She used to drink tequila, but the bar changed her.

## Narrative Significance

The Amber Hour is where the group became a group. It's where [[Elena Vasquez]] met [[Sam Reeves]], where [[Margot Chen]] announced she was leaving for Berlin, where [[David Okafor]] proposed to Isa (at the corner booth, on a Tuesday). Every significant conversation happened here. Now, when Elena visits alone or with David, it's like being inside a memory—the same bar, the same lighting, but the people are ghosts.

The bar has a subtle magical quality: time moves differently here. An hour feels like three. Elena sometimes leaves and finds that more time has passed than she expected, as if the bar exists slightly outside of regular time.

## Physical Description

Twenty feet wide, sixty feet deep. Bar runs the full length on the left. Five booths on the right, upholstered in cracked leather that was once burgundy and is now somewhere between brown and wine. A mirror behind the bar makes the room look twice as wide. The floor is black-and-white tile, chipped in places. Two bathrooms in the back with doors that stick. A small patio out back with three tables and a string of lights that are always on, even at noon.
