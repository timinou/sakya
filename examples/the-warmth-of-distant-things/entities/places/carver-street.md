## Atmosphere & Mood

Carver Street is a residential block lined with maples and three-story walkups. In fall, the leaves turn the whole street amber and red. In winter, the streetlights make halos in the fog. It's not a remarkable street—no landmark, no particularly beautiful building—but it has the quality of a place that has been deeply lived in.

At night, it stretches. [[Elena Vasquez]] has walked Carver Street hundreds of times and she swears the walk from the bus stop to her old apartment takes longer now than it used to. Not figuratively—literally longer. More steps. More time between the streetlights. As if the street knows she's measuring her distance from the past and is showing her exactly how far she's come.

## Narrative Significance

[[Elena Vasquez]], [[Sam Reeves]], and [[Margot Chen]] all lived on Carver Street at various points in their twenties. Elena's old apartment was on the third floor of number 247—the one with the fire escape where they used to sit on summer nights drinking wine from coffee mugs. She moved away two years ago but still walks down Carver Street when she wants to feel something she can't name.

## Physical Description

Six blocks long, running east-west. Mostly three-story brick walkups from the 1920s, some with corner stores on the ground floor. A laundromat at one end, a bodega at the other. Wide sidewalks buckled by tree roots. The sound of the street is mostly birds and occasional traffic. Someone is always playing music from an open window, but you can never tell which one.
