## Atmosphere & Mood

Elena's current apartment is in a newer building, twelve blocks from [[Carver Street]]. It's clean and quiet—too quiet, sometimes. The walls are white. The light is good for working. Borges the cat sleeps on a stack of manuscripts by the window. It's a perfectly fine apartment that doesn't yet feel like home.

The atmosphere is one of careful order. Books organized by language, then by author. A single plant that she keeps alive through pure determination. The [[Coffee Cup]] on the desk by her laptop, always warm. The [[Photographs]] on the bookshelf, facing the room.

## Narrative Significance

This apartment represents Elena's present—functional, a little lonely, not yet fully inhabited. It's the place where she does her translation work, where she listens to [[Margot Chen]]'s voice messages from Berlin, where she sits with her cat and looks at the [[Photographs]]. The contrast between this apartment and the remembered warmth of 247 [[Carver Street]] is the spatial embodiment of her emotional distance from her twenties.

## Physical Description

One bedroom, open kitchen. Fourth floor, no fire escape. Large windows facing east—good morning light. Hardwood floors, lightly scuffed. A desk by the window where she works. A couch that's comfortable but that nobody else ever sits on. The bedroom has a reading lamp and a stack of books that grows faster than it shrinks. The kitchen smells like coffee in the morning and nothing in particular the rest of the day.
