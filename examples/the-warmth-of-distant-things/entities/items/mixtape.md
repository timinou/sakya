## Origin Story

Not actually a tape—a burned CD in a paper sleeve, with the tracklist written in [[Sam Reeves]]'s handwriting. He made it for [[Elena Vasquez]] near the end of their relationship, though "end" isn't quite right because there was no ending, just an increasing space. He left it in her apartment the last time he was there. She found it a week later, next to the [[Coffee Cup]].

## Narrative Significance

The mixtape plays different songs depending on Elena's mood. She's never sure if it's the same tracklist she hasn't fully memorized, or if the songs are actually changing. When she's nostalgic, it plays slow, aching folk music. When she's angry at herself for holding on, it plays something percussive and forward-moving. When she's at peace—rarely—it plays [[Sam Reeves]]'s piano recordings, imperfect and earnest.

The songs she "hears" reflect her emotional state more than what's actually on the disc. This is the most ambiguous of the magical objects—is it literally magic, or is this just what it feels like to listen to music that someone you loved chose specifically for you?

Elena hasn't listened to the mixtape in months when the story opens. The act of finally playing it, in the penultimate chapter, is a turning point.

## Physical Description

A CD-R in a white paper sleeve. The sleeve has the tracklist written in blue ballpoint pen, slightly smudged. Sam's handwriting leans to the right—he's left-handed. The CD itself has "For E." written in black Sharpie on the silver side. Some light scratches on the playing surface. Elena doesn't own a CD player anymore; she plays it on her laptop's external drive.
