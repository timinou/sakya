## Origin Story

A collection of printed photographs from Elena's twenties—actual prints, not digital. [[Margot Chen]] was the photographer. She printed them at a darkroom co-op and gave sets to everyone. [[Elena Vasquez]] has about thirty, kept in a shoebox on her bookshelf. She's put five in frames on the shelf at [[Elena's Apartment]].

## Narrative Significance

The photographs change. Not dramatically—not so you'd notice right away. But the expressions shift. In the photo of the group at [[The Amber Hour]], sometimes [[Sam Reeves]] is looking at Elena. Sometimes he's looking at his drink. In the one from the fire escape on [[Carver Street]], sometimes [[Margot Chen]] is mid-laugh. Sometimes she looks contemplative, like she's already thinking about Berlin.

Elena is never sure if they're actually changing or if she's just seeing them differently each time. This ambiguity is the heart of the object—is memory shifting, or is she? The photographs are the physical manifestation of the unreliable narrator that is nostalgia.

In the final chapter, Elena looks at the photographs and sees them as they are: fixed moments, neither more nor less than what happened. The expressions don't shift because she's stopped needing them to.

## Physical Description

Standard 4x6 prints on matte photo paper. Slightly warm color cast from the darkroom processing—everything has a faint amber tone, which makes every photo look like it was taken during golden hour even when it wasn't. Edges slightly soft from years of handling. Five are framed in simple black frames. The rest live in a Nike shoebox with the lid held on by a rubber band.
