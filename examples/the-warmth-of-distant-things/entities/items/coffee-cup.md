## Origin Story

A ceramic mug, blue-gray with a hairline crack near the handle. [[Sam Reeves]] gave it to [[Elena Vasquez]] during their first winter together—not as a gift, exactly, but because he had two and she didn't have any. It's from a pottery studio that closed years ago. Nothing special about it except everything.

## Narrative Significance

The coffee cup is always warm when Elena is thinking about someone she misses. Not hot—warm. The temperature of a hand. She noticed it first a few months after [[Sam Reeves]] faded out of her life. She'd be working at her desk, thinking about nothing in particular, and she'd reach for the cup and it would be warm even though she'd made the coffee an hour ago.

She doesn't question it, exactly. She's a translator—she lives in the space between what's said and what's meant. The cup being warm is like that. It means something, and the meaning is the feeling itself.

The warmth fades as the story progresses. Not because the magic is leaving, but because Elena's relationship to her memories is shifting. In the final chapters, the cup is room temperature. The coffee is just coffee. And that's okay.

## Physical Description

Standard ceramic mug, slightly larger than average. Blue-gray glaze with subtle variations in tone—darker near the base, lighter at the rim. A hairline crack runs diagonally from the handle about two inches, barely visible unless you're looking. The bottom has an unglazed ring and a small stamp from the pottery studio: a circle with a wave inside. It holds about twelve ounces. The handle is comfortable for a right hand.
