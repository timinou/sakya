The coffee was cold. I knew it was cold because I'd made it at seven and it was now past ten, and three hours is long enough for anything to cool—a drink, a feeling, a friendship. The apartment was quiet in the way that apartments are quiet when you live alone: not silent, but unpeopled. Borges was asleep on the manuscript of a novel I was translating from the Spanish, a story about a fisherman who catches the same fish every day, and I was thinking about the word *añoranza*—which means something like nostalgia but with more ache in it, more body—when I reached for the cup.

It was warm.

Not hot. Warm. The temperature of a hand, of a forehead pressed against yours, of a thing recently held. I wrapped my fingers around the [[Coffee Cup]] and let the warmth seep into my palms and thought, not for the first time, that this was not a thing that coffee did. Coffee obeyed thermodynamics. Coffee cooled. Coffee went from scalding to acceptable to lukewarm to room temperature and then it sat there, being room temperature, until you poured it out and made more.

My coffee did not do this. My coffee stayed warm when I was thinking about people I missed, which was—I'd done the math—roughly sixty percent of my waking hours. More on Sundays. More in October, when the light went amber and everything looked like a memory even while it was still happening.

I drank the warm coffee and looked at the [[Photographs]] on the bookshelf. There were five of them, in cheap black frames, and in the one from [[The Amber Hour]]—the one [[Margot Chen]] took the night before she left for Berlin, the four of us crammed into the corner booth with the cracked leather and the light like honey—[[Sam Reeves]] was looking at me.

He wasn't always looking at me. Sometimes when I glanced at the photograph, he was looking down at his drink, or off to the left at something out of frame. I used to think I was imagining it, that it was a trick of the light or the angle or my own wishful thinking. But I've been a translator for eight years, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's that the space between what's said and what's meant is where the real text lives. The photograph was saying something, and the meaning changed depending on when I read it.

Today Sam was looking at me, and I was looking at the camera, and [[David Okafor]] was laughing, and Margot was a blur of motion—she was always a blur of motion—and the whole image had that warm amber cast that Margot's prints always had, like the darkroom itself was nostalgic.

My phone buzzed. A voice message from Margot, three minutes and forty-seven seconds long. She sent these every few weeks, always long, always vivid, always from a life that had nothing to do with mine anymore. I pressed play.

"Elena. It's—what time is it there? Afternoon? Morning? I never know. Anyway. I'm in this café in Kreuzberg and there's a woman at the next table reading Bolaño in Spanish and I thought of you. Obviously. Remember when we read *2666* together? You kept yelling about the translation. I'm working on the memory palace thing—the documentary—and yesterday I interviewed this woman in her nineties who remembers her childhood home in such detail that she can walk through it room by room, eyes closed, and describe the pattern on the wallpaper. She says the house is more real to her now than the apartment she lives in. Isn't that something? The past getting more vivid while the present fades? Anyway. I miss you. Come to Berlin. Or don't. Just—I miss you. Okay. Bye."

I listened to it twice. The second time, I translated it in my head—not into Spanish, but into the version of Margot I carried around, the one who was always about to leave, the one whose departure was the thing that broke the spell. In my translation, "I miss you" meant "I'm sorry I left" meant "I don't regret leaving." All three things at once, occupying the same space, the way certain words in one language require a whole sentence in another.

Borges yawned. The coffee was still warm.

I met David at [[The Amber Hour]] at eight. He always suggested the Amber Hour—out of loyalty or habit, I couldn't tell which, and I'd stopped asking because the answer didn't matter as much as the fact that we kept going. The bar was the same as it had always been. The Edison bulbs, the wooden bar, the jukebox that still played CDs. Someone had put on something by Chet Baker, and the trumpet wandered through the room like smoke.

"You look tired," David said. He was already seated in the corner booth—our booth, though we'd never called it that. He had a beer. His coat was on the bench beside him. He looked like what he was: a man in his mid-thirties who had figured out how to be happy without making it look like a performance.

"I'm always tired," I said. "It's a personality trait now."

"It's a Tuesday-in-October trait. You'll be fine by Friday."

I slid into the booth. The leather was cracked in the same places it had always been cracked. If I closed my eyes, I could feel [[Margot Chen]] beside me, her elbow in my ribs, her laugh sharp and sudden. I could feel [[Sam Reeves]] across the table, quiet and warm, his foot touching mine under the table in a way that wasn't an accident.

I did not close my eyes.

"Margot sent a voice message," I said.

"Yeah? How's Berlin?"

"Still Berlin. She's interviewing old women about memory palaces."

David nodded. He took a sip of his beer. "She's good at that. Getting people to talk."

"She's good at talking."

"That too." He smiled. David's smile was the kind that made you feel like everything was going to be fine, even when you suspected it wasn't. "You should go see her."

"In Berlin?"

"No, in the bathroom. Yes, in Berlin."

"I don't know."

"You know exactly. You just don't want to yet."

I ordered a mezcal. The bartender—the same bartender, always the same bartender—poured it without being asked and slid it across the bar. The bar was twenty feet wide and sixty feet deep and held roughly ten years of my life in its amber-lit interior. I looked at the clock above the mirror. Eight-fifteen.

We talked for what felt like an hour. About David's work—he was building a bridge, a literal bridge, and the metaphor was not lost on me. About Isa, his wife, who was pregnant with their first child and who knitted tiny socks in the evenings while David read engineering manuals. About the neighborhood, which was changing in the way that all neighborhoods change, which is to say becoming unrecognizable while insisting it's the same.

We didn't talk about Sam. We almost never talked about Sam. Sam existed in the space between what David and I said to each other—present in his absence, the way certain words are defined by what they don't mean.

When I looked at the clock again, it was ten-thirty. Two hours had passed. I had been at the bar for two and a quarter hours and it had felt like forty-five minutes. Time moved differently at [[The Amber Hour]]. It always had. I used to think it was because we were having a good time, because happiness compresses the hours. But now, sitting in the booth with David, I thought it might be something else. Something about the bar itself. Something about the light.

I walked home through streets that were longer than they should have been, past [[Carver Street]], which I didn't need to pass but always did, and the coffee cup was warm when I got home even though I'd left it on the desk for three hours, and the photograph on the shelf—the one from the Amber Hour—had shifted again. Sam was looking at his drink. Margot was in focus, for once, her face clear and still and beautiful and already gone.
