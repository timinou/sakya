I want to tell you about [[Carver Street]], but first I have to tell you about walking, because in this story they're the same thing.

I walk everywhere. I've always walked everywhere. When I was twenty-four and living on the third floor of 247 Carver, I walked to the bookstore where I worked part-time and to [[The Amber Hour]] and to [[Sam Reeves]]'s apartment, which was six blocks north, a distance I could cover in eight minutes at a pace that felt like anticipation. When I was twenty-six and Sam had moved to the other side of the city, I walked the same routes but slower, the way you walk through a museum—looking at things you've seen before, noticing details that don't matter, taking your time because taking your time is the point.

Now I'm thirty-three and I live twelve blocks east, in an apartment that has good light and no fire escape and a cat named after a writer who understood labyrinths. I don't need to walk down [[Carver Street]]. It's not on the way to anything. But I walk down it anyway, the way you reread a book you've already finished—not for the plot, but for the feeling.

Here is what I know about Carver Street: it is six blocks long. I've counted. I've measured with my phone's step counter. Six blocks, approximately twelve hundred feet, a distance that should take four minutes at a normal walking pace.

Here is what I also know about Carver Street: at night, it's longer.

Not metaphorically. Not *it feels longer because I'm sad* or *distances seem greater when you're nostalgic*. It is, by any reasonable measurement, longer. I've timed it. During the day: four minutes. At night: seven, sometimes eight. Once, in late November, when the fog was thick and the streetlights made halos and I was thinking about the Thanksgiving when all four of us cooked dinner in my tiny kitchen and [[Margot Chen]] set off the smoke alarm making gravy—that night, it took eleven minutes.

I don't tell anyone about this. Who would I tell? [[David Okafor]] would make a joke about my walking speed. Margot would want to film it. Sam—but I don't talk to Sam.

It was a Wednesday in late October when I walked Carver Street and the street did something new. I was between the laundromat and the bodega, in the middle of the second block, and I was thinking about the fire escape at 247. We used to sit out there on summer nights—me and [[Sam Reeves]], usually, sometimes with Margot and David, but mostly just us. The fire escape was barely legal. It creaked when you shifted your weight. Sam would bring his old acoustic guitar and play badly and I would pretend to read and neither of us was doing the thing we were pretending to do. We were just being near each other. That was the activity. Nearness.

I was thinking about nearness—the word for it in Spanish is *cercanía*, which also means proximity, which is more spatial, more measurable, but the emotional resonance is the same—when the street stretched.

I felt it. Not saw it—felt it. The way you feel an elevator start to move before you see the floor numbers change. The pavement under my feet shifted, and the distance between the streetlight I'd just passed and the streetlight ahead of me grew, and for a moment I was standing in the middle of a street that was wider and longer and emptier than any street in this city has a right to be.

The maples were taller. The streetlights were dimmer. The windows of the apartments above me were dark except for one, on the third floor of 247, where a warm yellow light was on, and I could see the shadow of a fire escape, and I thought—I knew—that if I looked up, I would see two people sitting there, young and unaware of how temporary the moment was, and that one of them would be me.

I did not look up.

I kept walking. The street contracted. By the time I reached the bodega on the corner, everything was normal—six blocks, four minutes, the usual distance between here and the past. My heart was beating faster than it should have been for a walk. The [[Coffee Cup]] would be warm when I got home. I already knew.

The thing about Sam is that we never broke up. I know I keep saying this, and I know it sounds like avoidance, like I'm refusing to name the thing that happened, but that's exactly the point: nothing happened. Something unhappened. We were together, and then we were less together, and then we were apart, and at no point did either of us say the words that would have made it real.

He moved to the other side of the city for a teaching job. He taught music to high school kids—guitar, piano, music theory. He was good at it in the way that people are good at things they were born to do: without effort, without ego, with a kind of patient joy that made you feel like learning was the most natural thing in the world.

He left the [[Mixtape]] in my apartment. A burned CD in a paper sleeve with the tracklist in his handwriting, which leaned to the right because he was left-handed. "For E." written on the disc in black Sharpie. I found it next to the [[Coffee Cup]] a week after his last visit—the visit I didn't know was the last visit, because that's how lasts work. You never know they're lasts until they're over.

I haven't listened to the mixtape in four months. It sits in my desk drawer, next to a pen that doesn't work and a bookmark from a store that closed. I tell myself I'll listen to it soon. I've been telling myself this for four months. The not-listening is its own kind of listening—a negative space in the shape of a song.

[[David Okafor]] asked about Sam once, about a year ago. We were at [[The Amber Hour]], in the booth, and David said, "Do you ever talk to Sam?" and I said, "We follow each other on social media," and David said, "That's not what I asked," and I said, "I know."

David didn't push. He never pushes. He just looked at me with those steady brown eyes and took a sip of his beer and changed the subject to bridge construction, which is, when you think about it, the most David thing imaginable. The man whose job is connecting two sides of a gap, sitting across from a woman who can't.

I went back to [[Carver Street]] the following night. I don't know what I expected—that the street would stretch again, that I'd see the light in the window of 247, that some door to the past would open and I could walk through it and sit on the fire escape and be twenty-five again, touching Sam's foot under the table at the Amber Hour, translating Margot's jokes from English into private smiles.

The street was normal. Six blocks. Four minutes. The apartments above me were lit in the regular way—some on, some off, none of them mine. Number 247 had new curtains in the third-floor window. Someone else's life, someone else's light.

I stood on the sidewalk across from the building and looked up at the fire escape and felt nothing magical. No stretching. No distortion. Just a street in October, just a building where I used to live, just the ordinary distance between who I was and who I am.

Borges would have something to say about this. The writer, not my cat. Something about the garden of forking paths, about the way every moment contains every possible version of itself. But I'm not Borges. I'm a translator. I take someone else's words and find the closest equivalent in another language, knowing that "closest" is never "same," that something is always lost in the crossing, that the gap between languages is the gap between selves and the best you can do is build a bridge.

Like David. Building bridges. Maybe that's what all of us are doing—building bridges between who we were and who we are, between the people we loved and the people we've become, between the past that won't stay still and the present that won't slow down.

I walked home the normal way. Twelve blocks. The apartment was quiet. The coffee was cold.

For the first time in months, the coffee was cold.

I made a new cup and sat at my desk and opened the translation of the fisherman novel and worked for two hours without thinking about anything except the distance between Spanish and English, which is a distance I know how to cross, which is a bridge I've already built. And when I reached for the cup at midnight, it was warm again—but differently warm. Not the warmth of missing someone. The warmth of coffee, recently made, in a kitchen that was starting to feel, if not like home, then at least like a place where I could stay.
