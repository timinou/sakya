# Neighborhood Research

## Visual and Sensory References

### Bars Like [[The Amber Hour]]
- Think of bars in the Nolita/LES tradition: narrow, deep, warm-lit, old wood
- Angel's Share (hidden speakeasy energy but more accessible)
- The kind of bar where the bartender knows your drink after three visits
- Edison bulbs are essential — they create the amber light that names the bar
- Jukebox that plays CDs, not streaming. Physical media. Intentional selection.
- Sound: always a low murmur, even when full. Never shouting-loud.

### Streets Like [[Carver Street]]
- Brooklyn brownstone blocks: Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, parts of Park Slope
- Three-story walkups from the 1920s, brick facades
- Mature maples that create a canopy in summer and a carpet in fall
- Sidewalks buckled by tree roots — the kind of imperfection that reads as character
- The sound of music from an open window that you can never locate
- Corner bodegas with cats in the window

### Apartments
- Elena's old apartment (247 Carver, 3rd floor):
  - Railroad layout or small one-bedroom
  - Fire escape facing the street (crucial — this is where she and Sam sit)
  - Kitchen too small for four people but they cook there anyway
  - Afternoon light from the west

- Elena's current apartment:
  - Newer building, cleaner lines, less character
  - Good light for working (east-facing windows)
  - The orderliness of someone who lives alone by choice but not entirely happily
  - Borges the cat on the manuscript pile

## Seasonal Notes

The story takes place primarily in **October**. This is deliberate:
- Amber light (connects to The Amber Hour, to the photographs' warm cast)
- Leaves turning — visual metaphor for change that's beautiful but terminal
- The specific quality of October evening light: golden, low-angled, nostalgic by nature
- Cool enough for warm drinks (the coffee cup's warmth matters more in October)
- The threshold month: summer is definitively over, winter hasn't arrived

## Sound Design (for prose)

Every chapter should have a soundscape:
- Ch 1: Chet Baker trumpet at the bar, the hum of the apartment, Margot's voice on speaker
- Ch 2: Footsteps on pavement, the creak of the fire escape in memory, silence at midnight
- Ch 3: Bookstore sounds, David's laugh, the click of Elena's keyboard
- Ch 4: The fisherman novel being read aloud (in Spanish), city sounds through the window
- Ch 5: The mixtape, obviously. Music as structural element.
- Ch 6: Room tone. The sound of a space with one person in it. Borges purring.
