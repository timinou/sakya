# The Warmth of Distant Things — Plot Outline

## Act One: The Weight of Amber

**Chapter 1: The Temperature of Memory**
- [[Elena Vasquez]] at home, working on a translation. The [[Coffee Cup]] is warm.
- Voice message from [[Margot Chen]] in Berlin about memory palaces.
- Evening at [[The Amber Hour]] with [[David Okafor]]. Time dilates.
- The [[Photographs]] shift. Sam is looking at her. Then he's not.

**Chapter 2: The Length of Carver Street**
- Elena walks [[Carver Street]] at night. The street stretches.
- She sees a light in the window of her old apartment (247, third floor).
- Memories of [[Sam Reeves]] and the fire escape. The [[Mixtape]] in her desk drawer.
- Second visit: the street is normal. The coffee is cold for the first time.

**Chapter 3: The Shape of a Voice** (planned)
- Margot's voice messages become the structure. Elena starts replying—actually replying, not just listening.
- David announces Isa is pregnant. The group's dynamic shifts again.
- Elena visits a bookstore where she used to work. It's smaller than she remembers.

## Act Two: The Distance Between Languages

**Chapter 4: Cercanía** (planned)
- Elena struggles with translating a passage about homesickness. The word *añoranza* won't map to English.
- She runs into someone who knows Sam. Learns he's well. Learns nothing else.
- The [[Photographs]] stop shifting—they're frozen on one expression. Elena panics.

**Chapter 5: The Frequency of Things** (planned)
- Elena finally listens to the [[Mixtape]]. It plays songs she doesn't expect.
- The music changes how she remembers: specific scenes re-colored by the soundtrack.
- Phone call with Margot. First real-time conversation in months. Margot sounds different—or Elena is hearing her differently.

## Act Three: The Present Tense

**Chapter 6: Room Temperature** (planned)
- Elena visits [[The Amber Hour]] alone. Sits in the booth. Time moves normally.
- She writes a letter to Sam. Not to send—to say the unsaid thing.
- The coffee cools. The photographs are fixed. The street is six blocks long.
- Not loss—release. The warmth is hers now, not the cup's.

## Structural Notes

- First person throughout. Elena's voice is precise, slightly detached, using translation metaphors.
- Magical elements are always ambiguous. Could be literal. Could be perception.
- Each chapter has a physical manifestation: temperature, distance, sound, image, time.
- The progression is from magical (objects doing impossible things) to mundane (objects being objects) — but the mundane is earned, not deflating.
