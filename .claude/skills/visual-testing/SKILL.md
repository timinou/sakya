# Overview  Visual testing catches unintentional layout or style regressions that functional tests miss. It operates at two levels:  1.  **Visual regression baselines** — Playwright's `toHaveScreenshot()` compares against committed PNGs 2.  **AI-readable screenshots** — saved to `e2e/screenshots/` for Claude Code to inspect via the Read tool  # Screenshot Types  ## Regression Baselines  Committed in `e2e/__snapshots__/`. Playwright compares each test run pixel-by-pixel (with `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01` tolerance).  - Generated with `bun run test:visual:update` - Verified with `bun run test:visual` - Must be updated after intentional visual changes  ## AI-Readable Screenshots  Saved to `e2e/screenshots/` (gitignored, ephemeral). Regenerated on every test run.  - Used by Claude Code: `Read e2e/screenshots/home--initial-load.png` - Produced by `takeAIScreenshot()` and `takeStepScreenshot()` from `e2e/utils/screenshots.ts` - Useful for autonomous review of UI changes without running the app  # Workflow  ## Adding Visual Tests for a New Page  1.  Add test in `e2e/visual.spec.ts` using `toHaveScreenshot()` 2.  Optionally add `takeStepScreenshot()` for AI-readable copies 3.  Run `bun run test:visual:update` to generate baseline 4.  Commit the new baseline PNGs in `e2e/__snapshots__/`  ## After Intentional Visual Changes  1.  Run `bun run test:visual` — expect failures on changed pages 2.  Review the diff in `test-results/` to confirm changes are intentional 3.  Run `bun run test:visual:update` to regenerate baselines 4.  Commit updated baselines  ## CI Behavior  - Visual tests run as part of `bun run test:e2e` (all Playwright tests) - Failure screenshots and AI-readable PNGs uploaded as CI artifacts - Baselines are committed, so CI compares against the same reference  # When to Consult This  Consult this process when:  - Adding a new page or route - Changing layout or CSS significantly - Refactoring component structure that affects rendering - Reviewing visual QA for a feature  # See Also  - [Testing Engineer](../agents/testing-engineer.org) — owns visual regression suite - [Verification and Testing](../reference.org::#verification) — `visual` TEST<sub>PLAN</sub> value
