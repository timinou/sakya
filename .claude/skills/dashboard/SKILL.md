# Overview  The Dashboard skill gives you a comprehensive view of the project's current state: available skills and agents, task metrics, blockers, and suggested next actions.  Invoke with `/dashboard`.  # Step 1: Available Skills  Present all available skills, grouped by scope:  ## Project Skills (from @tasks/process/)  | Skill | Command | Purpose | |----|----|----| | Multi-File Changes | `/multi-file-changes` | Methodology for 3+ file changes, vendored code, cross-crate work | | Task Runner | `/task` | Pick and start the next task from @tasks | | Dashboard | `/dashboard` | This skill - orientation and project overview |  ## Global Skills (from ~/.claude/)  | Skill | Command | Purpose | |----|----|----| | Architect | `/architect` | Create architectural plans with alternatives analysis and edge cases | | Feature Dev | `/feature-dev` | Guided feature development with codebase understanding | | Find Skills | `/find-skills` | Discover and install new agent skills | | Veo Video Generation | `/veo-video-generation` | Generate videos from images or text using Google Veo API |  To discover more installable skills, use `/find-skills`.  # Step 2: Available Agents  Present all 5 project agents with their domains and assignment guidance:  | Agent | Domain | Assign When | |----|----|----| | svelte-developer | Svelte 5 UI, runes, Tauri IPC | Pages, components, stores, frontend IPC | | rust-architect | Tauri commands, module design, async | Backend commands, module architecture, traits | | testing-engineer | Vitest, Playwright, integration | Unit tests, E2E tests, test infrastructure | | lexical-specialist | Lexical editor, custom nodes, Markdown | Editor plugins, custom nodes, transformers | | writing-app-designer | Feature specs, UX, entity schemas | Specifications, UX flows, data models, file formats |  Agent definitions live in `@tasks/agents/*.org`. For the full assignment matrix, see [Agent Registry: Assignment Matrix](../agents/index.org::#matrix).  # Step 3: Task Metrics  Query the PRD system for current metrics:  ``` bash emacsclient -s sakya -e '(prd-dashboard-cli)' ```  Present the metrics clearly:  ## Overall Progress  Show totals from the dashboard JSON:  - Total tasks, complete, in-progress, blocked, pending - Overall completion percentage  ## Progress by Category  For each category (PROJ-001 through PROJ-006, any BUG-**, IMP-**):  - Title, total items, completed items, progress bar/percentage  ## Agent Workload  From the `agents` section of the dashboard JSON:  - Tasks assigned vs completed per agent - Which agents have the most pending work  ## Error Handling  If emacsclient is unavailable, fall back to direct file scanning:  1.  Read all `@tasks/{projects,bugfixes,improvements}/*.org` files 2.  Count TODO keywords: `ITEM`, `DOING`, `REVIEW`, `DONE`, `BLOCKED` 3.  Group counts by parent file 4.  Present manually-computed metrics  # Step 4: Blocked Items  Query for blocked tasks:  ``` bash emacsclient -s sakya -e '(prd-list-blocked)' ```  For each blocked item, show:  - The blocked item's ID and title - What it's blocked by (dependency IDs and their current status) - Whether the blocker is close to completion (DOING/REVIEW)  Highlight critical blockers: items that block many downstream tasks.  # Step 5: Recent Completions  Query velocity data:  ``` bash emacsclient -s sakya -e '(prd-velocity-report 7)' ```  Show:  - Tasks completed in the last 7 days - Velocity trend (increasing, stable, decreasing) - Which categories had the most activity  # Step 6: Quick-Start Actions  Based on the current state, suggest contextual next actions:  ## If there are blocked items with resolvable blockers  Suggest: "Unblock ITEM-XXX by completing ITEM-YYY (currently DOING, agent: rust-architect)"  ## If there are high-priority pending items  Suggest: "Start on ITEM-XXX (Priority \#A, effort: 1h) — use `/task ITEM-XXX`"  ## If a project is near completion  Suggest: "PROJ-XXX is 90% complete — 2 items remaining to finish"  ## If no tasks are available or all are blocked  Suggest: "All tasks are blocked or complete. Consider:"  - Creating new tasks for upcoming work - Reviewing BLOCKED items for stale dependencies - Running `/find-skills` to discover new capabilities  ## General suggestions  - "Run `/task` to pick your next task" - "Run `emacsclient -s sakya -e '(prd-validate-all-cli)'` to check for validation issues"  # See Also  - [Process Registry](index.org) - [Task Runner](task-runner.org) - For picking and starting a specific task - [Multi-File Changes](multi-file-changes.org) - For complex cross-file work - [Agent Registry](../agents/index.org) - All available agents - [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) - Claude Code integration guide - [Reference Guide](../reference.org) - Full PRD system documentation
