* Overview

:CUSTOM_ID: overview
:END:

Process documents capture cross-cutting methodology — how agents work, not who they are. Agent definitions live in [[file:../agents/index.org][agents/]]; process docs live here.

Consult these before starting work that matches their trigger conditions.

| Process | File | Consult When |
|---------+------+--------------|
| Multi-File Changes | [[file:multi-file-changes.org][multi-file-changes.org]] | 3+ files, vendored code, cross-crate boundaries |
| Task Runner | [[file:task-runner.org][task-runner.org]] | Starting work on a task, picking next task |
| Dashboard | [[file:dashboard.org][dashboard.org]] | Orientation, project status, discovering skills/agents |

* Adding New Process Docs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: adding-docs
:END:

Add a new process doc when:
- A failure mode recurs across multiple initiatives
- A successful approach deserves codification
- Multiple agents need the same discipline

After creating the file:
1. Add entry to this index
2. Link from relevant agent files if appropriate
