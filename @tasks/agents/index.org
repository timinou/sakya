Agents represent specialized expertise profiles for task assignment. Each agent has defined skills, responsibilities, and guidance on when to assign tasks.

** Agent Philosophy

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Apex expertise" means the agent represents the absolute best-in-class capability for their domain. Tasks should be assigned to the agent whose expertise most directly matches the work required.

| Agent | File | Primary Domain |
|-------+------+----------------|
| Svelte Developer | [[file:svelte-developer.org][svelte-developer.org]] | Svelte 5 UI, runes reactivity, Tauri IPC |
| Rust Architect | [[file:rust-architect.org][rust-architect.org]] | Tauri commands, module design, async |
| Testing Engineer | [[file:testing-engineer.org][testing-engineer.org]] | Vitest, Playwright, integration |

* Assignment Matrix

| Svelte page/route implementation | svelte-developer | rust-architect |
| Svelte component creation | svelte-developer | - |
| Svelte stores and runes state | svelte-developer | rust-architect |
| Tauri IPC with @tauri-apps/api | svelte-developer | rust-architect |
| Tauri command design | rust-architect | svelte-developer |
| Module architecture | rust-architect | - |
| Trait design | rust-architect | - |
| Async patterns | rust-architect | - |
| Vitest unit tests | testing-engineer | svelte-developer |

| Integration tests | testing-engineer | rust-architect |

** By Component Area

| Area | Primary Agents |

* Agent Interaction Patterns
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: interactions
:END:

** Handoff Patterns

*** Architecture -> Development -> Testing
1. rust-architect defines Tauri commands and module structure
2. svelte-developer implements UI with Svelte 5 runes and Tauri IPC
3. testing-engineer verifies with tests

*** Feature Flow
1. rust-architect designs feature architecture
2. rust-architect creates Tauri command API
3. svelte-developer creates UI
4. testing-engineer writes tests

*** Cross-Cutting Concerns
- testing-engineer reviews all components for testability
- rust-architect advises on error handling patterns

* Adding New Agents
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: adding-agents
:END:

** When to Add

Add a new agent when:
- Existing agents lack required expertise
- A task type appears frequently with no clear owner
- Specialization would improve quality

** Agent Definition Template

Create a new file in =agents/= with this structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+TITLE: [Agent Name]
,#+AUTHOR: Sakya Development Team

,* Identity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: identity
:END:

,** Name
[Full agent name]

,** Apex Expertise
[What makes this agent world-class in their domain]

,* Core Competencies
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: competencies
:END:

,** Primary Skills
- Skill 1
- Skill 2

,** Tools & Technologies
- Tool 1
- Tool 2

,* Responsibilities
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: responsibilities
:END:

,** Owns
- Responsibility 1
- Responsibility 2

,** Supports
- Supporting role 1

,** Boundaries
- Does NOT do X

,* Assignment Criteria
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: assignment
:END:

,** Assign When
- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2

,** Do NOT Assign When
- Anti-pattern 1

,* Quality Standards
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: standards
:END:

Standards this agent upholds.
#+END_SRC

** Registration

After creating the agent file:
1. Add entry to this index
2. Add to assignment matrix
3. Run =prd-validate-all= to verify links
