* IMP-006 Safe N-Process Concurrent Playwright Execution
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: IMP-006
:GOAL: Allow multiple concurrent `bunx playwright test` processes without port conflicts or server teardown races.
:COMPLETION: globalSetup with flock coordination replaces webServer config. Concurrent processes share a detached dev server. All existing E2E tests pass.
:END:

** DONE Replace Playwright webServer with detached globalSetup

*** Description
Replace Playwright's built-in =webServer= config with a =globalSetup= script that:
1. Checks if port 1420 is already listening (fast path for pre-existing =bun run dev=)
2. Uses =flock= to serialize startup across concurrent processes
3. Starts =bun run dev= as a detached process (=nohup ... &=) that survives Playwright teardown
4. Writes PID to =/tmp/sakya-playwright-dev-server.pid= for manual cleanup
5. Waits for the server to respond before returning

Also adds =test:e2e:stop-server= convenience script to =package.json=.

*** Acceptance Criteria
- [X] =e2e/global-setup.ts= created with flock-based server coordination
- [X] =playwright.config.ts= uses =globalSetup= instead of =webServer=
- [X] =package.json= has =test:e2e:stop-server= script
- [X] Single-process =bun run test:e2e= passes all existing tests
- [X] Multiple concurrent =bunx playwright test= processes don't crash
