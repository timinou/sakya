* IMP-002 Recent Projects List on Launcher
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: IMP-002
:GOAL: Add a "Recent Projects" list to the launcher so users can one-click reopen previously visited projects instead of navigating to the folder every time.
:COMPLETION: Rust backend stores/retrieves recent projects in app data dir, launcher UI shows recent list, E2E tests cover all flows.
:END:

** TODO Add RecentProject model and Rust commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ITEM-107-recent-projects-rust
:AGENT: [[file:../agents/rust-architect.org::#core][rust-architect:core]]
:EFFORT: 2h
:PRIORITY: #A
:FILES: src-tauri/src/models/project.rs, src-tauri/src/commands/project.rs, src-tauri/src/lib.rs
:TEST_PLAN: unit
:END:

*** Description
Add =RecentProject= struct to models. Implement 3 new Tauri commands:
- =list_recent_projects=: Read + validate (prune stale paths) + return
- =add_recent_project=: Upsert entry, bump timestamp, trim to 10, return updated list
- =remove_recent_project=: Remove entry by path, return updated list

Storage: =recent-projects.json= in Tauri app data dir (=~/.local/share/com.undefine.sakya/=).
Helper functions accept =PathBuf= for testability (no =AppHandle= needed in unit tests).

*** Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] RecentProject model with name, path, lastOpened fields
- [ ] list_recent_projects reads, validates, prunes stale entries
- [ ] add_recent_project upserts and caps at 10
- [ ] remove_recent_project removes by path
- [ ] Edge cases: missing file, corrupt JSON, stale paths
- [ ] Commands registered in lib.rs

** TODO Add frontend store and launcher UI
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ITEM-108-recent-projects-ui
:AGENT: [[file:../agents/svelte-developer.org::#core][svelte-developer:core]]
:EFFORT: 2h
:PRIORITY: #A
:FILES: src/lib/stores/project.svelte.ts, src/routes/+page.svelte
:TEST_PLAN: e2e
:END:

*** Description
Update =projectState= with =recentProjects= state array and methods (=loadRecent()=, =removeRecent(path)=).
Update launcher =+page.svelte= to show recent projects list between header and action buttons.
Hook into =open()= and =create()= to call =add_recent_project= after success.

*** Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] projectState has recentProjects array and load/remove methods
- [ ] Launcher shows recent projects when list is non-empty
- [ ] Each entry shows name, truncated path, click to open, X to remove
- [ ] Opening/creating a project adds it to recent list
- [ ] Empty state (no recent projects) shows just Create/Open buttons

** TODO Write E2E tests for recent projects
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ITEM-109-recent-projects-e2e
:AGENT: [[file:../agents/testing-engineer.org::#e2e][testing-engineer:e2e]]
:EFFORT: 1h
:PRIORITY: #A
:FILES: e2e/app.spec.ts, e2e/utils/tauri-mocks.ts
:TEST_PLAN: e2e
:END:

*** Description
Add mocks for the 3 new commands. Write E2E tests covering:
- Recent projects appear on launcher
- Clicking a recent project opens it
- Remove button removes from list
- Empty state shows just Create/Open buttons

*** Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Mocks for list/add/remove recent projects
- [ ] Test: recent projects displayed on launcher
- [ ] Test: click recent project -> opens it
- [ ] Test: remove button removes entry
- [ ] Test: empty state shows default buttons
